Good morning, 
Thanks for reaching out and following up. I’m always interested in learning more about how non-legacy companies are approaching the depo and lit support space, I get approached often by companies exploring this area.  I suppose we're one of the first stops since we are the largest independently owned reporting firm in the area.  

I’d be glad to set aside some time to talk. We’ve seen firsthand all of the challenges in this area, so it will be interesting to hear how Filevine is approaching it.

I have free time tomorrow between 10am-12pmCST and Thursday 3pm-4pm.  If those don't work for you, just let me know when does.

Essentially. They want to put you out of business. They’re a huge VC backed firm that doesn’t care about you.

Edit: I’ve spoken to many our or “competitors” in the reporting space and they have overwhelming been “go away you’re asking me to give you my labor to put me out of business”. 

It’s funny. The reason I mention “legacy companies” is because they’re trying to come in and take over decade old companies and we’ve all seen this throughout the years. It doesn’t work. No one cares about you. It’s built on personal relationships and not some stupid ad.

It’s so bad we have national companies trying to enter our space that offer “pay when the case settles, we’ll fund your case”.

ndujs2r,Law,legaltech,"nan What you're asking is to create a free community version of existing paid software such as Westlaw or LexisNexis.

I think it's a huge ask, and also such data is something the existing legal tech AI vendors desperately need to train or fine-tune their models. Only the big firms such as Thomson Reuters or LexisNexis have a hold of such data they've spent decades curating. 

Harvey recently partnered with LexisNexis to access their database, but it's a very limited access as it can only search the database but not train on the data which is ridiculous. 

If you were to create it, you would need a large existing number of legal researchers and lawyers who are willing to spend countless hours creating such a massive dataset, which is a much smaller pool of people than the wikipedia editors.

I'd say it's doable but to find highly talented people to do such work for free is not an easy sell, not to mention maintaining such service and the finances to host it.

nd8lz8k,Law,legaltech,"nan I spent several months working for my firm to conduct a detailed analysis of options on the market. I strongly argued against Harvey, Copilot, or any other LLM wrapper, instead advocating procuring enterprise versions of both Claude and GoogleAI (Gemini for its immense context window, and NotebookLM for powerful but convenient RAG).

I saved the 2000-ish pages of sources for my report in NotebookLM, and in response to your question I asked it to articulate the “prosecution case” against Harvey. While Legora and similar tools are less high profile, I do not see how they avoid the same problems, including how they avoid simply being low-value LLM wrappers, bundled with API calls, prompt libraries, and basic RAG engines. 

Further, even if they provide marginal value, they are at risk of obsolescence (with obvious problems for users at one’s firm) as the frontier models advance. Please see earlier postings from me four months ago, as I began work on my report, where I quoted warnings by Sam Altman to the same effect (that vast swathes of the AI ecosystem faces extinction as the frontier models advance and destroy niches currently populated by LLM wrappers).

**Please do provide constructive criticism: very happy – indeed, enthusiastic - to have people shoot holes in my argument. Thanks in advance!**

Response follows. The numeric references are to sources within my notebook.

“Here is the ""prosecution case"" against Harvey, articulated concisely in bullet points based on the provided sources:


*   **High Cost and Opaque Pricing:** Harvey is criticized for its expensive pricing, reportedly around **$1,200 per seat per year with a 100-seat minimum**, which effectively prices out most small and mid-sized law firms [1-8]. Its pricing strategy is described as lacking uniformity and transparency, with costs negotiated on a case-by-case basis [3, 9, 10]. Some also suggest its Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is extremely high, potentially leading to issues at renewal [11].

*   **Perceived as a ""GPT-Wrapper"" with Limited ""Legal DNA"":** Many critics dismiss Harvey as merely a ""thin UI on top of GPT"" or a ""pretty wrapper around generic LLMs"" rather than offering true technological innovation [2, 4, 12-19]. Concerns are raised about the company's lack of deep legal expertise (""Legal DNA""), pointing to the CEO's limited (one year) BigLaw experience and the technical co-founder's lack of legal background, suggesting a product vision not fully rooted in the practical realities and pain points of legal practice [11, 20-24].

*   **Product Performance and Functionality Gaps:** Early versions of Harvey were called ""half-baked garbage"" by some users [25]. Its ""Assistant"" tool's responses are sometimes found to be ""sterile"" and lacking awareness of the user's context or experience [26, 27]. The ""Vault"" functionality has reportedly not met some users' expectations [28], and its workflows are seen as ""disjointed"" and ""unimpressive"" by others [29, 30].
 
*   **Underwhelming Integrations:** The highly anticipated integration with LexisNexis is described as ""underwhelming"" and effectively just ""routing"" queries to Lexis's own AI tool [31-37]. This limited access suggests that LexisNexis is protecting its core data and proprietary logic, preventing Harvey from fully leveraging these critical resources to enhance its ""muscle"" and ""memory"" in legal reasoning [32, 35, 38].

*   **Risk of Hallucinations and Trust Issues:** Like other large language models, Harvey's outputs are considered fundamentally unreliable and prone to ""hallucinate"" (making up false information or citations), requiring constant human verification of its work product [16, 39-42]. The persistence of the hallucination problem in legal AI tools, even with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), poses significant risks in high-stakes legal matters [42-44].

*   **Questionable ""Moat"" and Competitive Position:** Critics argue that application-layer companies like Harvey lack a sustainable competitive ""moat"" as the underlying Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly commoditizing [38, 45, 46]. Many competitors, including general foundation models like ChatGPT, are perceived by some lawyers as offering comparable or superior utility at a significantly lower cost [17, 25, 47-50].

*   **Aggressive Marketing and ""Hype Machine"":** Harvey is accused of employing an aggressive ""raise and burn"" strategy, prioritizing the accumulation of prestigious law firm logos and building a ""category-defining narrative"" through strong marketing and Public Relations, rather than focusing solely on product superiority [2, 18, 51-53]. This approach is seen by some as contributing to a ""Silicon Valley bubble"" in legal tech [54, 55].

*   **User Adoption Challenges and Ethical Concerns:** Despite its promotion, law firms face significant hurdles in AI adoption, and Harvey's high cost and perceived lack of transparency do not necessarily ease this. The use of cloud-based AI raises concerns about data privacy, confidentiality, and ethical walls [1, 41, 56, 57].

1n5eetn,Law,legaltech,"Looking for narrative-style eDiscovery dataset for research Hey folks - I’m working on a research project around eDiscovery workflows and ran into a gap with the datasets that are publicly available.

Most of the “open” collections (like the EDRM Micro Dataset) are useful for testing parsers because they include many file types - Word, PDF, Excel, emails, images, even forensic images - but they don’t reflect how discovery actually *feels*. They’re kinda just random files thrown together, without a coherent story or links across documents.

What I’m looking for is closer to a realistic “mock case” dataset:  
• A set of documents (emails, contracts, memos, reports, exhibits) that tell a narrative when read together (even if hidden in a large volume of files)  
• Something that could be used to test workflows like chronology building, fact-mapping, or privilege review  
• Public, demo, or teaching datasets are fine (real or synthetic)

I’ve checked Enron, EDRM, and RECAP, but those either don't have narrative structure or aren't really raw discovery.

Does anyone know of (preferably free and public):  
• Law school teaching sets for eDiscovery classes

ndfe2jo,Law,legaltech,"nan Interesting question.

From what I’ve seen working with law firms, they’ve definitely been experimenting with AI, but it really depends on the size of the firm:

* BigLaw (AmLaw 200): They’ve got the resources, so they’re either (i) testing a bunch of horizontal tools (Harvey, Legau, Legora, etc.) and vertical ones (for contracts only, for IP only, for pleadings only, etc.), or (ii) building their own stuff in-house. When they build internally, it’s usually to (a) figure out what AI can/can’t do for their specific workflows, (b) solve a niche problem vendors aren’t interested in, or (c) roll out client-facing tools to expand their service offering.
* Small firms: Way less resources, so they’re mostly dabbling with general tools like ChatGPT Pro. If they find legaltech that’s tailored to their market (Legau, Legion Law, Descrybe AI, etc.) *and* there’s a free trial, they’ll give it a spin. Overall it’s a lot more reactive than strategic, though of course there are exceptions.
* Mid-size firms: Kind of a mix. You see both approaches.

As for use cases, reports from Thomson Reuters, Clio, etc. give a good overview of specific use cases (e.g. drafting emails, drafting contracts, etc.), but in practice most firms are still using AI to streamline existing processes. They’re not really reimagining workflows yet, more like “how can this make what we already do faster/cheaper?”",['clio'],interesting question from what ive seen working with law firms theyve definitely been experimenting with ai but it really depends on the size of the firm biglaw amlaw theyve got the resources so theyre either i testing a bunch of horizontal tools harvey legau legora etc and vertical ones for contracts only for ip only for pleadings only etc or ii building their own stuff inhouse when they build internally its usually to a figure out what ai cancant do for their specific workflows b solve a niche problem vendors arent interested in or c roll out clientfacing tools to expand their service offering small firms way less resources so theyre mostly dabbling with general tools like chatgpt pro if they find legaltech thats tailored to their market legau legion law descrybe ai etc and theres a free trial theyll give it a spin overall its a lot more reactive than strategic though of course there are exceptions midsize firms kind of a mix you see both approaches as for use cases reports from thomson reuters clio etc give a good overview of specific use cases eg drafting emails drafting contracts etc but in practice most firms are still using ai to streamline existing processes theyre not really reimagining workflows yet more like how can this make what we already do fastercheaper,positive

ndzlq3k,Law,LawFirm,"nan Westlaw/Practical Law is your best friend. Spend any free time you have learning the process and making/understanding the checklists and procedure. 

Many try to jump into the learning the hardest client specific items they see without understanding the basics. Learning the client specific/hardest pieces really just means watching someone else do it in large firms. Nothing wrong with watching, but your value add is making the easy things as easy as humanly possible for the next person working on the same matter. 

My area was M&A and I learned by reading (in Practical Law) the M&A practice notes, closing checklists and all documents required (and what their purpose was), then asset purchase agreements (buyer friendly & seller friendly templates with negotiating tips) then the same process with stock purchase agreements. 

It used to take 5+ years to learn what you can now learn in 1 so that the “hands on” experience in client matters is not learning process/procedure & client items at the same time because you already have a “best practices” foundation and know what the other side of the deal will likely say to/about your client’s position.

If you don’t know where to start… 

1. Ask yourself: “What is the worst outcome?” 
The answer is likely something like “Not being helpful to the firm” “Not hitting my hours because I don’t have work” and/or “Making mistakes that I should not make”. All these hit the same issue of not knowing what you’re doing and what you are doing is not helping.

2. Then ask yourself: “How would I almost ensure that I am not helpful, I don’t hit my hours, I make mistakes that others do not?” 
The answer is likely: I do not to learn the pieces of my work that happen with the highest volume.

3. Now your goal is to do the opposite and the question is how to go about doing it (my solution provided above). 

Also - As you learn, break everything into 4 buckets: 
1. What you know how to do. 
2. What you think is right but have a clarifying question about. 
3. What you have in your work product that cannot possibly be accurate. 
4. What you do not know and cannot be expected to know. 

Example #1: Spelling client’s name right, basic proofreading for errors, starting with the right template document, clean formatting.

Example #2: Dates in your document and source material match, but you’re concerned the source material/notes from the client may be wrong or they have conflicting information. Placeholders for missing pieces. 

Example #3: (not a bankruptcy specific example) If you’re drafting a negligence claim (4) elements to negligence… review that your work product has all 4 elements before sending to partners. Do not simply have missing pieces that they should expect to identify are missing entirely.

Example #4: If a client specific item/fact pattern only happens once every 10 years… cut yourself some slack, it’s called the practice of law for a reason.

It’s slow, but I followed the red pen blue pen approach… first pass was red pen for grammar/typos etc and blue pen was for substance. 

Do not fool yourself into thinking “I’d rather have good substance with typos than bad substance in perfect form”. When you are first starting in a large firm, you see very little of the big picture, have no experience, and for those reasons, have a harder time knowing what is important substance wise. You will likely miss on substance entirely for this reason at least a few times and partners will be fine with that because it gives them something to teach strategy/logic (which they do actually enjoy). However, grammar/typos are the first thing a reviewer sees and they cause a complete loss of confidence in substance by thinking “If he can’t get the dates right, there is no way he can fully research conflicting case law across multiple district courts”.",['westlaw'],westlawpractical law is your best friend spend any free time you have learning the process and makingunderstanding the checklists and procedure many try to jump into the learning the hardest client specific items they see without understanding the basics learning the client specifichardest pieces really just means watching someone else do it in large firms nothing wrong with watching but your value add is making the easy things as easy as humanly possible for the next person working on the same matter my area was ma and i learned by reading in practical law the ma practice notes closing checklists and all documents required and what their purpose was then asset purchase agreements buyer friendly seller friendly templates with negotiating tips then the same process with stock purchase agreements it used to take years to learn what you can now learn in so that the hands on experience in client matters is not learning processprocedure client items at the same time because you already have a best practices foundation and know what the other side of the deal will likely say toabout your clients position if you dont know where to start ask yourself what is the worst outcome the answer is likely something like not being helpful to the firm not hitting my hours because i dont have work andor making mistakes that i should not make all these hit the same issue of not knowing what youre doing and what you are doing is not helping then ask yourself how would i almost ensure that i am not helpful i dont hit my hours i make mistakes that others do not the answer is likely i do not to learn the pieces of my work that happen with the highest volume now your goal is to do the opposite and the question is how to go about doing it my solution provided above also as you learn break everything into buckets what you know how to do what you think is right but have a clarifying question about what you have in your work product that cannot possibly be accurate what you do not know and cannot be expected to know example spelling clients name right basic proofreading for errors starting with the right template document clean formatting example dates in your document and source material match but youre concerned the source materialnotes from the client may be wrong or they have conflicting information placeholders for missing pieces example not a bankruptcy specific example if youre drafting a negligence claim elements to negligence review that your work product has all elements before sending to partners do not simply have missing pieces that they should expect to identify are missing entirely example if a client specific itemfact pattern only happens once every years cut yourself some slack its called the practice of law for a reason its slow but i followed the red pen blue pen approach first pass was red pen for grammartypos etc and blue pen was for substance do not fool yourself into thinking id rather have good substance with typos than bad substance in perfect form when you are first starting in a large firm you see very little of the big picture have no experience and for those reasons have a harder time knowing what is important substance wise you will likely miss on substance entirely for this reason at least a few times and partners will be fine with that because it gives them something to teach strategylogic which they do actually enjoy however grammartypos are the first thing a reviewer sees and they cause a complete loss of confidence in substance by thinking if he cant get the dates right there is no way he can fully research conflicting case law across multiple district courts,positive

ndf7pdf,Law,LawFirm,"nan Coming from the DAs office it’s gonna be tough at first, but everybody has told you the important thing you’ve got to own managing your time entries and you must do them contemporaneously. We use my case practice management software. It has many competitors smoke ball Clio but if your firm doesn’t use practice mgt software, then you’ve gotta make a move— the onus is on you. 
See what the cost is for one subscription to my case or Clio. Time entry is very easy on both as is adding expenses such as FedEx charge, electronic filing fee if you’ve got them.. etc 
My case CLIO smokeball all have phone applications that works for android and iPhone thus in addition to be able to put in your time in on the computer, where you probably spend the most of your time you’ve got the ability to add time using your phone application and it can be a lifesaver in the middle of writing paper then you have a 15 minute conversation from a different case and client. While are you still looking at your computer and you can use the application on your phone to input the time even as you begin the conversation you can put in what you estimate and then straighten it out later. Be really descriptive and detail the steps you took with respect to the task. Don’t block bill. it’s against the ABA model rules and sophisticated clients will complain.. an example would be you created special interrogatories, request for production of documents and request for admissions. Each of those should be an entry. You wouldn’t make one entry listing all of those things. Here’s how an entry might look /// reviewed ‘Bates stamps  pages00 20  to 0033 from rule 26 disclosures  (or if you’re firm doesn’t use the federal rules of criminal procedure which ever statute of your state code of soul procedure requires initial initial disclosure assuming they do) and created outline of discovery .5 hours. Prepared 14 special interrogatories. 2.2 hrs ://prepared seven request for admission .7 // prepared  23 request for production of documents    1.3 hrs. Nothing takes an hour. You should bill in units of 1/10 of an hour or six minutes. Back when dinosaurs roam the Earth and I started working. I worked for an enormous law firm, and they made it quite clear that pretty much everything was based on my billings and the quality of the work qua my success at the firm .

We have an established DMZ with its own domain, and own Windows datacenter licensing, so my thought was to throw a Windows Server VM in our DMZ with MS DHCP Server, consolidate all of our guest Wi-Fi DHCP pools to that server, and create the necessary ACLs to allow Guest Wi-Fi clients to hit that DHCP server to get addresses.

1nfgmva,Tech,sysadmin,"Yet another running away from VMware post... I don't know many other sysadmins I can pick their brains on. So to the reddit hivemind I go lol

We're a medium sized non-profit (around 200 office users that interact with our single on-prem server & another 800 users that use only OWA). Just like practically everyone we got hit with a super high renewal with the whole VMware and Broadcom thing.

Looking at our single VM. I feel like the single on-prem server we run is unnecessary (Server 2019). The most important thing it does is file share (around 500GB of data) and Active Directory. It is also AD-synced (or now called Entra Connect) to our O365 tenant. So it feels like this is now an opportunity to make the jump from hybrid to cloud (I know it won't happen overnight but to start moving towards that direction).

Our licenses are mostly all Microsoft E1 and E3 licenses.

The options I've been presented:
-Move over to HyperV (or some other hypervisor solution)
-Move into Microsoft Sharepoint as our a file share replacement (+ the difficulty of training my users to use Sharepoint)
-Move into a private cloud setup
-Move to Azure File Share (curious to know what this was like)
-Use some sort of NAS solution
-Anything else???

Another reason I want to move away from our on-prem server. Being a non-profit there isn't much discounts to be had for hardware (and now licensing). We already use Office365 heavily as Microsoft gives us licensing at such high discounts (alittle salty they took away the non-profit E1 grant... but what can you do). The challenge I'm having is trying to decide on a solution that can give my users the closest thing to a normal file share experience as possible on their computers and I really am interesting in hearing from other sysadmins first hand experiences.

Its the social work industry and my co-workers already deal with enough crazy on the daily. I don't want them to struggle accessing files and having to learn a new file system to be apart of that. Something I can get them that is as close as possible to a regular plain old Windows NFS. And without sounding like I drank the Microsoft kool-aid, moving as much as I possibly can into the Microsoft eco-system (it just seems like the most sense for us).

ne4bkx9,Tech,sysadmin,"nan i moved to sharepoint from onprem windows fileshare this past month. sharepoint is not designed to perfectly replace your fileshare, so it depends what type of contents you have and your needs.  For me i mostly had documents, photos, PDF's, etc. a few apps and access databases but nothing crazy. For me sharepoint was fine, if you're needy you'll need azure file share instead.

For sharepoint you'll have to setup onedrive shortcut for users so they can have the files on their PC. onedrive is fine, but make sure you disable old onedrive sync button and only use the shortcut button. (google this). Also, you are limited to 300,000 files synced to your PC, otherwise the onedrive client will lag.

The biggest partner of my company asked us to implement file-level encryption at rest.

At the moment we use a mix of windows and linux file servers.  
We've evaluated different road using encryption platform but it doesn't seem a good approach.

Since we are collaborating with many external collaborators and we need a smart and secure way to share files I'm thinking to change approach on file storing.

We work with these type of files:

* CAD Files
* Office Files
* 3D Files
* Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop/In Design Files Files

I want to take this opportunity to cover other security requirements.

This is what the solution has to cover:

* File-level encryption
* External Sharing with authentication
* SSO with EntraID
* Versioning
* Create team/group folders with user-level permission.
* In future: Data Classification
* In future: Data Loss Prevention capabilities
* Possibility to backup data in an on-prem repository

I need also to share data with OT Machines in the factory. These machines supports only FTP/SMB Connection. A solution could be having a VM that sync data from the cloud and expose a legacy share.

We are comparing these solutions:

* Nextcloud on-prem with Netapp Ontap for storage (s3 storage gateway).
* Nextcloud hosted in cloud with Cubbit for backend(Geo-distributed s3 storage)
* Box (we are already have 50 users on this to work with our biggest partner)
* Sharepoint
* Kiteworks

If you don't control the CA, this or upgrading the DCs so you can use the tuple method is your best bet. We have a similar situation with a widely distributed, high-turnover workforce being issued certificates from a third party we don't have access to, who all need logon-level access to the system we run using those certs on smartcards. On top of that, the third party IDP we're federated with doesn't collect the full public half of the certificate so we can't just go query that. We had to do the tuple method but I really want to get this fixed the right way also.

The error 39 thankfully has enough info (serial number, policy OID, thumbprint, issuer and subject) that you can use it for mapping, as you've been doing. But, it's a good excuse to upgrade your DCs as well...nothing's holding you on 2016, right? Even going to 2019 will buy you another few years.

I’ll essentially be their only IT person, responsible for maintaining and upgrading hardware and the network, provisioning new user devices, and handling pretty much anything tech-related. There is an operations/facilities person, but they don’t know much about tech. Right now, the environment is somewhat small, with 20–30 users, two servers, a NAS, and a legacy phone system.

The company is still pretty raw when it comes to IT policies and best practices. Their last IT person has already left, so I suspect any training and handover will be a mess.

1nf7k45,Tech,sysadmin,"Old SUSE Distro (SLES, Kernel 2.6) Fails to Boot from SSD RAID 1 After Install [Heres the Boot Log] (https://postimg.cc/mPKB4nxQ)

Hello everyone,
I'm hoping to get some help with a persistent boot issue I'm facing while trying to install an older Linux distribution (SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop, Kernel 2.6.27) on a system with modern SSDs.
The Setup:
• OS: SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop (appears to be based on the 4.6 version of a product named ""adw"") with the 2.6.27 kernel.
• Disks: Three SSDs.
• Disk 0 (/dev/sda): Used for the /boot partition.
• Disk 1 (/dev/sdb) & Disk 2 (/dev/sdc): Configured as a software RAID 1 (mirror) for the root filesystem (/).
• The Issue: The installation from the CD completes without any errors. However, on the very first reboot, the system fails to find the root filesystem on the RAID array.

During the boot failure, the kernel log shows the following error. It waits for a device with a very specific, non-standard name and then fails to find it, asking me to fall back to /dev/sda2.
Waiting for device /dev/sda2_480GB_251945801198-part2 to appear...
Could not find /dev/sda2_480GB_251945801198-part2.

1nf4eyo,Tech,sysadmin,"HP Procurve Routing Issue? We've got an old Procurve 5400 series switch acting as a core switch for one of our networks, including inter-VLAN routing. The uplink from this switch to our firewall is currently gigabit, and is often saturated due to uploading camera data to the cloud. We're moving this to a 10gb fiber uplink to mitigate this, and are seeing no traffic being routed out to the new interface. Below is a quick rundown, sanitized:

Uplink is using VLAN 70

Current uplink config:

    interface A1
        untagged vlan 70
        spanning-tree instance ist path-cost 20000
        spanning-tree root-guard
        exit

The new uplink was configured to match:

    interface F6
        untagged vlan 70
        spanning-tree instance ist path-cost 20000
        spanning-tree root-guard
        exit

Module A is a standard 24-port gigabit ethernet module, and F is an 8-port SFP+ module.

Somewhat complicating matters, we're able to ping out to the internet across the new uplink from the switch itself, but any pings or traffic from a client device stop at the switch and do not progress. The IP routing table on the switch shows the proper default gateway:

    Destination  Gateway      VLAN   Type    Sub-Type  Metric  Dist.
    ------------ ------------ ------ ------- --------- ------- ------
    0.0.0.0/0    10.10.10.14  70     static            1       1

I don't see anything in the logs of the switch that indicate dropping traffic or STP blocking the port. I'm also not seeing anything that would indicate a route or MAC stuck to a specific port.

1nesbza,Tech,sysadmin,"After almost a decade of recovery, I'm back to being a sysadmin and I think I like it... I thought I'd finally recovered and managed to fully join the ranks of recovered sysadmins when I finished my PhD and was made redundant from the software house I worked for. Honestly it was a bit of a relief as I'd been ramping things down while I was studying - I'd gone from network administration to remotely babysitting the monthly M$ patch cycle for the servers we couldn't tolerate unplanned downtime on. Really I wasn't a sysadmin at this point, so I was thankful for the push.

I embraced the fresh start in academic life and jumped into research, working on a series of projects where the only admin I was doing was my own systems. No demands, no users, no on-call. Aside from the subtle battles with university IT to get what I needed (Yes I really do need that many systems, yes I do need IPv6, no you can't take my network ports...), life was bliss. Someone else was responsible for managing the big compute, I was ""just"" a user.

Then I made a mistake. As I moved up the greasy pole of academic positions, I started planning research and was pulled into teaching. Given my background, networking and computer architecture were the obvious specialities. Given how esoteric and experimental some of the technologies are, no one else knew how to manage them so I ended up admining a couple of systems with some fun FPGA accelerators in them. No big deal I thought, a little bit of automation and I can make this pretty painless.

That was a bit over three years ago and as you are probably expecting because I'm posting here, it didn't stop at a just a couple of systems. As the frequency of posts on alt.sysadmin.recovery diminished, my admin responsibilities increased. My colleagues realised I knew what I was doing and could get things done with University IT that they couldn't, and now I'm now responsible for managing multiple compute clusters that support several million $ of academic research. The sort of systems that corporate university IT don't want to touch with a barge pole, but are needed to make the research and teaching happen.

The shift back to being a sysadmin was inevitable I suppose, but the difference between then and now is that instead of business-critical Windows servers, I'm managing Linux systems with esoteric hardware that's held together by custom drivers I have to maintain. What does the future hold though?

University IT seems to go through cyclical phases of being more and less corporate. When it gets more corporate, the shadow IT run by academics increases, coalescing on a few who try to do it properly. My experience placed me perfectly for this downfall, but how far am I going to fall? Departments may even end up with their own pseudo-IT team to work around the central bureaucracy, only for these teams to be subsumed by central IT when it goes through a phase of being less corporate. Unfortunately the pendulum swings the other way and as things get more corporate, and the people who get pulled in like this often leave as the transition happens and they are tasked with more mundane responsibilities. Is this my destiny? To be dragged kicking and screaming back into corporate IT as I clutch to the weird and whacky, only to be cast out when I won't conform?

For now I seem to be embracing the life of a sysadmin again. I picked up [some stickers](https://i.imgur.com/MupZX0X.jpeg) at a recent open-source conference, and one of them (Moss in the fire) is proudly stuck on my office door proclaiming my place as a sysadmin. My beard even seems to agree with this path as I've started finding the occasional grey hair, my journey to a greybeard looks to be a certainty.

Despite falling out of recovery, I'm still an academic and I find myself wanting to know the truth: Is permanent recovery possible? Can one ever escape the life of a sysadmin? Or is it just an illusion?

ndtu2es,Tech,msp,"nan Hi all, I lead the Professional Services team for Pax8 Americas, and I wanted to personally address this concern. 

I’ve reached out directly to the comment OP to understand the specifics of their deployment and project context. 

To clarify our standard practices:

* **Opening port 3389 to the public WAN is** ***not*** **a practice we follow in Professional Services.**
* **We deploy Azure Bastion as part of our Azure deployments**, which provides secure and hardened remote access without exposing RDP ports.
* AVD session hosts are not assigned public IP addresses by default. They are only accessible via the AVD endpoints or through a VPN into the Azure virtual network.
* In the **rare** cases where port 3389 is opened, it is strictly restricted to allowed IP addresses, never left open to the public internet.

We’re human, and while we strive for excellence, mistakes can happen. If this was indeed a misconfiguration on our part, we’ll get to the bottom of it and ensure it doesn’t happen again. 

Thanks for flagging this and keeping us on our toes, this type of feedback is essential so that we can spot mistakes when they happen.

ndu2iwn,Tech,msp,"nan Thanks for the follow-up, I could have been clearer in my wording.

To clarify: it is never *standard* practice for our team to open port 3389 on the WAN (it is of course commonplace in VPN scenarios), and we do not allow *any/any* configurations under any circumstances. If a partner were to request that, we would decline and explain why.

Opening 3389 instead of using Bastion would be a documented exception, and any such deviation is tracked in our project management system.

As I mentioned, I’m actively working to get more details on this specific partner’s deployment to determine whether a mistake occurred, and if so, we’ll correct it.

We follow a defined set of guidelines for Azure projects, including:

* Pax8-specific administrative identities
* Mandatory MFA
* No public exposure of port 3389
* And other best practices

We also review our work regularly, through both peer and leadership reviews. These checks help us catch discrepancies before they become issues. That said, across hundreds of deployments and migrations, mistakes can occasionally happen, and when they do, we treat them seriously.

Just like I did at my own MSP, we use these moments to improve our processes and close any gaps that allowed the issue to occur.

We need feedback like this, it helps us stay sharp and continue improving.

1neobl4,Tech,msp,"Looking for some assistance, not sure how deep I want to go, down this path. I had a long post typed up and I tried to provide all the details, but then it just became a wall of text and I don't think that would be a good start to asking for some help in an odd position that I'm in.

I have my own company for side work (not MSP, just installing small networks for small businesses). I have a daily IT job and the handful of customers I have, know that I am tied up during work hours.

A former non-IT co-worker quit his job to buy an already established business. This business has 4 office workers and about 10 field technicians. They have computers that were bought from various box stores and no central directory server for user management, yes, all local accounts on the PCs. No two factor, no patch management, etc...nothing.

I have not been asked by him to help, but I'm getting the feeling from a few phone calls (general chatting which leads to work talk) that he will ask for my assistance. Yes, he knows I have a full time job and that I can't help him during the day, but they aren't a 24/7 shop and he has mentioned that internet/computers aren't 100% needed for business to proceed. They do use a cloud app for their daily work orders that could be accessed from any computer, an ipad and/or their phone as a hot spot for a computer that does work if they ever had internet or office computer issues.

He has MS Office 365 with business email that is in use, but all he had to do was buy a license, he isn't sure how it was set up or who configured the MX records, etc. He is working on figuring that out. There are other users with company email, he isn't the only one, but I don't know how many, yet.

If I were to consider taking him on as a client I would want to know the following things (which is why I'm here).

1. Is it possible to use MS Azure/Entra ID fully in the cloud? I don't want any AD server on-prem. If the answer to this is yes, I assume this is something that can be added to their existing MS Office 365 plan. We use Entra ID at my day job, but I am more on the network side and we have many AD servers that sync with MS Azure and I was not involved in setting that up because I'm not on the sysadmin side.
2. Is there a go to RMM vendor for small MSPs that don't have minimum user license counts? If I were to proceed with him, I would make this a requirement. NinjaOne is one that I've seen mentioned here before, but I don't know if it does it all. I'd like the RMM to handle everything, if possible. Patch management/drivers/updates, virus/spyware/ransomeware protection (if that's a thing in RMMs today), etc.

I know there is more to the MSP part than these two questions, but he didn't have answers to a lot of my questions (he has only been in this position for a few weeks) and he is going to work on getting some more answers and I wanted to get some answers of my own, in the meantime.

I've asked him if he has cybersecurity and who handles his credit card processing and he is going to get back to me.

He doesn't know if they use file shares running on server in the office, or a NAS or if everything is in one drive and nothing is saved in the office.

1mh797h,Tech,talesfromtechsupport,"Stupid problems require stupid solutions. Remember the heartbleed bug? That mean vulnerability in the OpenSSL library that made for quite some hectic days in 2014?  
For our company, that bug came in a very unfortunate moment: The regulatory agency responsible for us had ordered a security audit just then - and passing it was critical.

In theory, getting all our devices in order for the audit's vulnerability check should've been a breeze. 90% of our user devices consisted of custom Linux thin clients, with a very streamlined deployment process: Get update files, push update to test group, validate it, deploy image files to production → all devices update themselves automatically by the next reboot.

This worked great for all machines that were powered off, because when the users came in and switched them on, they updated themselves before login and were current for the audit the same morning.

Those that were left running by users at the end of their workday would've just required a remotely triggered reboot... Due to a freak coincidence, however, the current OS build suffered from a previously undiscovered bug that prohibited reliable execution of any remote shutdown command. So we frantically needed to find a solution for this, or we'd have a severe number of vulnerable devices left in the fleet!

Brainstorming within our team led to the conclusion that manually finding and rebooting those of the hundreds of thin clients that were left running was too time consuming and prone for human error. Some machines were also locked behind closed office doors IT had no key for. Then one of us had a brainwave:  
""Hang on - aren't those machines set up with 'Restore on Power Loss = Last State' in the BIOS?""

You know what IT *did* have a key for? The main facilities room which housed the central power breakers for our HQ.

1meagra,Tech,talesfromtechsupport,"Never assume. Yes, I mean that. TL,DR: I'd have to make assumptions about the reader to summarize this post. I now know better.

I've spent several years prior to this entertained by some of the excellent stories by users such as Gambatte, Lawtechie, Airz23 *^((what about the keyboards?))*, Mr\_Cartographer, et cetera - but didn't expect that I'd end up adding to the pile so soon. That being said, this was a pretty entertaining one that I'm sure the more senior members here will get a chuckle out of.

Background for you lovely folks:

Shortly before I arrived at **$Facility**, the recording team started having issues with an external sound card, likely driver-related. Enterprise sound cards designed for Windows 10 do not always play nice with Windows 11 - thanks for nothing, Microsoft. The exact source of the problem has been difficult to diagnose and fix; in the meantime, a Mac Studio was dropped in as a stopgap,, which brought its own issues.

We use **$SANSoftware** at **$Facility**. For those not familiar with the term - a SAN is essentially a *very* fancy drive mapping solution. **$SANSoftware** lets our users mount any network drive they are authorized to, and potentially create or resize new virtual volumes if given the appropriate permissions. The entire system is composed of multiple RAID clusters that have a expiry date set by the vendor, to avoid cascading failure with aging drives.

Now. On with the tale!

  
**$Mentor** and I had been aware of an issue with **$SANSoftware** on the new Mac for a while now - we could *view* the virtual drives, but *not* mount them. Given that it was on a separate VLAN from the physical servers and all of the other machines running **$SANSoftware**, **$Mentor** had made the assumption that we simply needed IT to assign it an IP within the same VLAN as the rest of the SAN hardware and users.

""Hang on,"" you say. ""You're supposed to be IT. IT manages storage, backups, et cetera.""

Normally, yes. Here? Apparently not. There are a large number of blurry lines in the sand at **$Facility** as to where different departments' purview begins and ends. Generally, machines are domain-joined, with a few users outside IT such as **$Me** and **$Mentor** having administrator permissions on domain machines. However, a lot of our equipment comes from specialized vendors and is pretty sensitive to any kind of meddling with firewall configurations, thanks to various various *thing-over-IP* protocols - not to mention the occasional PCIe FPGA hardware and other fun obscure things that IT simply can't account for. These machines are *not* domain-joined and are instead managed by us on local accounts, or by other users who know what they are doing. User competence is shockingly high at **$Facility** thankfully, which saves us a lot of work.

Back to the story. Over the course of a few days, **$Mentor** contacted IT and requested an IP for the Mac on the same VLAN as our SAN. Instead of doing so, IT conducted a few tests with **$SANSoftware** and determined that the SAN was accessible from any VLAN on campus except the public-facing network - and sent a few pointers back along with their result, one of which was to double-check the permissions for the Mac's user.

So we did. In fact, we spent the next three hours troubleshooting. We learned two things from it:

* **$SANSoftware** did in fact function perfectly on the same VLAN - just not on the Mac. We had no issues interacting with the SAN when we put a Windows machine onto the network and spun up a fresh install of the software.
* It was *not* a permissions issue. We built a fully working setup for our test Windows machine, then ported each and every setting over to the Mac user's configuration and server-side permission settings.

Then I caught something out of the corner of one eye. As **$Mentor** moused over the ""connect"" button for one of the drives, a tooltip popped up: *Failed to create mountpoint*.

Oh. Great. I think we all know where this is going now.

Sure enough, 5 minutes of Google-Fu later and there it was - a little blurb in the system settings indicating that **$SANSoftware**'s extension had been blocked from loading at boot. No privileged extension equals no ability to create mountpoints. One reboot later and a bit of searching to figure out exactly where **$SANSoftware** was mounting the drives, we had a working solution.

Now. Where does the assumption come in? Well, according to **$Mentor**, this is a known issue with the install. One of the more competent users had taken care of installing **$SANSoftware** to save us some time **-** and didn't know that it was necessary to explicitly allow the software's extension to load. We assumed the install was fully functional, and that it therefore must be a networking issue.

One underrated feature of working in a mixing room is the soundproofing. You can swear at whatever misbehaving technology you like all day, and nobody will hear you. Suffice to say there was a healthy dose of that at the end of our troubleshooting session, followed by some healthy chuckling on my part. I've read *so many tales* of assumptions turning out poorly, and even after all that was still bitten by a basic one.

1md56xg,Tech,talesfromtechsupport,"How do they not get it? The people i work with are driving me slowly insane.

I had to have a very long in depth discussion with several of my colleagues over some remote engineering.

All I was doing was requesting a new SSL certificate from sectigo and using openSSL to manipulate it from being a pfx file, into a cer and key file so it can be uploaded into an azure hosted debian linux machine which runs the client's phone system.

""you need to be on site to do this!"" was the start of it.

""Pardon?""

""you need to go to site to do the SSL work, as it's for their phone system""

""What?""

""as you are installing this, you need access to their phone system!""

""you do realise this is a hosted phone system?""

""O.K. so do you need to be scheduled in to go to the branch office nearest you, or the head office in the city?""

""it's hosted in a microsoft azure data center""

""well, give us the address for the DC then!""

my head hit my hands so hard i think it broke my desk

""o.k. i'm not sure i have the time or the crayons necessary to explain this. I do the SSL creation on my own laptop and using a web portal for Sectigo, this can be done from anywhere in the world, no need to be anywhere specific. Installing a certificate is NOT a physical action, there is no device that needs to be connected for this to happen, it's a transfer of data and a reconfiguration.

1m3ax9l,Tech,talesfromtechsupport,"Sometimes, you have to be firm with them One of our stores had a power outage. Not a huge deal, it happens, we can deal. Due to some recent work on the network, however, we didn't have everything in the network closet running on the UPS (yet), and when the power came back on, the SDWAN box - the one single point of failure - didn't boot up correctly. It would route WAN traffic, but not LAN.

Note: When we upgrade our phones to VOIP, we pull cable for each phone, separate from the computer network, so the phones are entirely outside of our network. More expensive, but there are . . . reasons (and good ones). The SDWAN box thus has (or, rather, uses) two LAN ports, one for us, one for the phones.

Our telecom provider had, of course, detected the outage and automatically opened a ticket. They detected that the SDWAN was back up, and closed the ticket. The store was still offline, and was less than 100% efficient at letting me know, but when they did, they told me the phones were still down as well. This was the second store this exact thing had happened at in two weeks, and the first one took an on-site visit by a tech to reconfigure the SDWAN box. This was late on a Friday.

Once I found out, I reopened the ticket, and explained that with the phones down as well, it has to be the SDWAN box that's acting up. They looked at it, saw the SDWAN was showing as online, couldn't see our firewall behind it, and closed it again. ""We show you're online in the orchestrator."" Sigh.

So I reopened it a second time, made it clear we were still offline, and *so are the phones*, which are *outside of our network*, same result, same message, word for word, closed again. This is Saturday afternoon. We've been offline for two days at this point, which is painful, but not a huge deal, but the phones have been down as long, and that *is* a big deal.

So, OK, we're a six figure a year account (with about two dozen locations now) with a platinum support team, so I emailed our account rep and asked her to escalate the ticket. It was Saturday afternoon by this point, so I didn't actually expect a quick response. I was wrong. Less than five minutes, I get cc'd on the message to the escalation team. And less than two minutes after that, I get an email from the escalation team. Woo-hoo! Things are happening!

*The SDWAN is up.  I do not see your internal network equipment switches/routers/firewalls).*

Yeah, things are happening, but all progress is backwards.

""For the fourth time, the phones are not working. The phones are not on *our* network. They go through a separate switch that plugs directly into the SDWAN. There is no part of our network that can affect phone service. The SDWAN is not communicating with its own LAN side.

""For the fourth time, this is the *exact* same thing that happened after a power outage at another location last week that required an on-site visit to reconfigure the SDWAN because the configuration got corrupted by the power outage.""

I did get an apology after that, and he was able to get into the box remotely and get it working in less than half a hour (unlike the previous incident).

1lvoxwu,Tech,talesfromtechsupport,"Internet slows down the computers (2) After reading [Internet slows down the computer](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1lvdrsp/internet_slows_down_the_computer/), I was reminded of two times over the years where businesses thought they knew best. It's always interesting to know (or wonder) how people think.

**First**: We took over IT support at a small regional bank around 2005. Three locations. Upon onboarding assessment, we discovered their HQ location had two data drops at each station. Not too unusual on the surface; one was connected to the PC's onboard NIC while the other was connected to the PC's add-in NIC. OK then, I assumed one NIC went to their main/production network while the other must surely connect to a different network or VLAN, maybe for their bank core processing or something. Until I dug deeper and found out they didn't; all NICs connected to the same set of switches. Alright; surely they have some VLANs in place, separating things out? No, no they don't; it's all VLAN1, everywhere.

I asked and finally talked to someone who was around when they built the building in the 90's. Whichever IT contractor they worked with at the time told them they'd be more secure if they had a separate NIC in each PC for Internet access. They thought they were accomplishing this by plugging a separate NIC into the same switch & VLAN. How or why they assumed this I never found out, but thus began the process of disconnecting all the second, redundant network connections!

**Second**: It's 2015 now and I was called to perform some upgrades at a small company involved in the farming sector. 10 PCs or so. Went there to assess what needed to be upgraded (as the customer said they have old PCs and need new ones but aren't sure what). I look around and ask basic questions, like what line of business apps do they have, what they have for Internet service, etc., and as I ask the Internet question my contact shows me ""Oh, we plug this in when we need to get online"" - and he grabs a second Ethernet cable at his desk connected to a (currently disconnected) USB NIC. That network cable was plugged into their standalone cable modem in the basement (you know the one, with 4 LAN ports).

I asked, ""Does everyone have one of these?"" ""Not everyone, just the three of us,"" I was told. As it turns out, this small, family-owned company was run by a very sweet (but very old) lady, who was so scared of Internet access she insisted people plug in when they need to get online, do their thing, then unplug it. And forget about Wi-Fi! After some gentle discussion with her, I was able to convince them to include a proper firewall in the scope of their upgrades and thus eliminated the need for them to have to plug in manually every time they wanted to get online.",['firewall'],internet slows down the computers after reading internet slows down the computer i was reminded of two times over the years where businesses thought they knew best its always interesting to know or wonder how people think first we took over it support at a small regional bank around three locations upon onboarding assessment we discovered their hq location had two data drops at each station not too unusual on the surface one was connected to the pcs onboard nic while the other was connected to the pcs addin nic ok then i assumed one nic went to their mainproduction network while the other must surely connect to a different network or vlan maybe for their bank core processing or something until i dug deeper and found out they didnt all nics connected to the same set of switches alright surely they have some vlans in place separating things out no no they dont its all vlan everywhere i asked and finally talked to someone who was around when they built the building in the s whichever it contractor they worked with at the time told them theyd be more secure if they had a separate nic in each pc for internet access they thought they were accomplishing this by plugging a separate nic into the same switch vlan how or why they assumed this i never found out but thus began the process of disconnecting all the second redundant network connections second its now and i was called to perform some upgrades at a small company involved in the farming sector pcs or so went there to assess what needed to be upgraded as the customer said they have old pcs and need new ones but arent sure what i look around and ask basic questions like what line of business apps do they have what they have for internet service etc and as i ask the internet question my contact shows me oh we plug this in when we need to get online and he grabs a second ethernet cable at his desk connected to a currently disconnected usb nic that network cable was plugged into their standalone cable modem in the basement you know the one with lan ports i asked does everyone have one of these not everyone just the three of us i was told as it turns out this small familyowned company was run by a very sweet but very old lady who was so scared of internet access she insisted people plug in when they need to get online do their thing then unplug it and forget about wifi after some gentle discussion with her i was able to convince them to include a proper firewall in the scope of their upgrades and thus eliminated the need for them to have to plug in manually every time they wanted to get online,positive
1luah2o,Tech,talesfromtechsupport,"Tales from the $Facility: Part 7 - And The Horse You Rode In On Hello again, everyone!  This is my next story from the **$Facility**, wherein we tell **$VacuumCorp** precisely where to stick it.  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records (and I have started taking notes specifically so I can write stories for TFTS!)  There's also a lot that comes from rumors, gossip, and other people, but most of this is very recent, so any inaccuracies are entirely on me.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.

TL/DR: Well, well, well, if it isn't the consequences of my actions.  We meet again.

For some context, I'm not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional.  This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale.  However, for reference, all these stories take place at my new job working as the GIS Manager at the **$Facility**, a major industrial entity in the American South.  Here's my Dramatis Personae for this part:

* **$Me**: Your friendly neighborhood GIS guy.
* **$Distinguished**: Vice President of Engineering.  Talented, well-connected, opinionated, and my direct boss.  He was honestly a very nice, friendly person, but I always found him a little intimidating.
* **$GlamRock**: Primary server guy for the $Facility.  Name taken from the fact that he was a legitimate rock star in the 1980s.  Now he works in IT.  Life, amirite?
* **$VPofIT**: Vice President of IT.  Extremely concerned about security and likes to get into the weeds, but ultimately not a mean-spirited manager.
* **$GiantCo**: Nationwide engineering firm that had convinced the $Facility to start a GIS program.  Ultimately a good company with highly skilled people, but had a different idea of how to approach this than I did.
* **$VaccuumCorp**: CSP that was hired to start our cloud standup.  They sucked.  Their name is a testament to their awfulness.  Lol.
* **$OverConfident**: Main rep from $VacuumCorp.  Cocky, arrogant, overpromising, and ultimately kind of shady.  Whoops, looks like you got a little hubris on your face, let me wipe that off for you.
* **$FinanceLady**: A finance professional at $VacuumCorp that proved to be quite scatterbrained and forgetful.  Kept forgetting to follow up with us for payment.

When last we left off, I had sought out an answer from the contracted company (**$VacuumCorp**) building our cloud-based enterprise instance, asking them why the cost for the system was grossly outside what we had agreed to pay for initially.  Upon having a very heated conversation with them, I realized they had not included the price for a mission-critical security protocol (***$SecurityPolicy***) in our original estimates, even though they had been informed repeatedly that it was necessary.  With this in mind, the disgust I felt for them knew no bounds.  I wanted to break ties with this company and scrap this entire project to go in a different direction, but my boss (**$Distinguished**) told me that I had to have **$VPofIT**'s approval before doing so.

So today, I was dolled up, walking into a one-on-one meeting with **$VPofIT** to ask precisely that.

Let me say that I was quite nervous here.  I had spoken to **$VPofIT** plenty in the time leading up, and I could even go so far as to say we had been friendly.  But he was very high up the food chain.  And I was about to talk to him about some very serious cr4p - this wasn't us shooting the sh!t over what GIS could do (as we'd done previously).  I made sure to have my documentation, my laptop, and everything else I'd need.  And I also spent way too much time fixing my tie and my collar in the mirror in the bathroom.  It probably wasn't necessary.  Oh well.

Anyways, I waited in the conference room for him, and pretty much right on time, he walked in and we got to talking.

I laid out the situation.  Our vendor, **$VacuumCorp**, appeared to have been dealing with us in bad faith.  This was evidenced by them omitting the cost of ***$SecurityPolicy*** from our estimates, then lying to me that they didn't know about it when I asked them.  I wanted to drop them as a vendor.  **$VPofIT** wrinkled his brow and asked me what evidence I had that they knew about this policy.  I pulled out the Scope of Work document I'd gotten in January, almost a year before.  It had been signed by our IT Server Team, and I thought that this was the actual SOW that we were actively working under. On the second page of that document, it clearly referenced ***$SecurityPolicy*** as one of terms of the agreement.  I passed it over to **$VPofIT**.  He read it, frowning.  A minute or so later, he looked up at me.

>**$VPofIT**: I see that this is signed by our server team.  Did you ever get a copy back from $VacuumCorp, signed on their end?

>**$Me**: No.  I figured that you all were just giving me the document during one stage of the signing process, and y'all would keep the executed version in the IT record-keeping system.

>**$VPofIT**: I see.  Looks like somebody didn't do their homework.  Do you remember all that mess we went through getting the terms and conditions approved for your cost estimates last summer?

>**$Me** (clearly remembering that clusterfsck): Yes.  Yes, I remember.  All too well.

>**$VPofIT**: That's because *THAT* document was the actual SOW that we are operating under.  Not this (holding up the paperwork I had given him).  Doesn't excuse $VacuumCorp from not knowing about $SecurityPolicy, as it is still clearly listed on a document they wrote as part of this project.  But check this out.

**$VPofIT** proceeded to rip the last three pages of the document from where I'd stapled them together and passed them to me.  They were the terms and conditions for this SOW - ones that I had never reviewed, *because I never thought I'd had to*.  The IT Server Team had been the ones to get this document; they'd signed it before I'd even had a chance to look at it.  I had assumed they'd done their due diligence whenever doing so.

>**$VPofIT**: Notice anything?

>**$Me** (reading over the document, a sinking realization coming into my mind): This... this is the same set of terms that we had for the estimates last summer!  The ones from before we sent this off for legal review.  It has a bunch of things that we took out... and a bunch of things that are not enforceable, or even *legal*!

>**$VPofIT** (pissed): Yep.  You're d4mn right.

Unbeknownst to me, I had opened an entirely new can of worms.  I hadn't expected this at all.  As mentioned, I thought that the IT Server Team had done their due diligence whenever signing contracts and things like that.  But as it turns out, they hadn't.  *They hadn't at all*.  The SOW we were looking at happened to be the first draft of the contract between us and **$VacuumCorp**.  The server team - **$GlamRock** in particular - had signed it without even *looking* at it!  It held a ton of provisions that would have gotten us into immense trouble and could have resulted in hundreds of thousands, even *millions*, in damages!  On top of this, they weren't even the folks authorized to sign this in the first place.  Incredibly, they'd never sent this on to **$VacuumCorp**, but had they done so (and had **$VacuumCorp** countersigned), this agreement would have become actionable - and we would have been on the hook for all this mess!

I had no idea.  **$VPofIT** was livid.  The quiet type of livid that means *some sh!t is about to go down*.

Eventually, he took a deep sigh and calmed himself.  He said he would take care of this on his end.  He then said to me, absolutely, we could get rid of this vendor (**$VacuumCorp**).  He told me to call them up and tell them that we were terminating the agreement.

I was *insanely* relieved to hear this.  But I'd also never fired a vendor before.  After continuing for a moment, I asked a candid question:

>**$Me**: So, uh... I've never fired a vendor before.  How, um, exactly, do I do that?

For the first time all meeting, **$VPofIT** smiled.  He sort of chuckled when he said for me to call them and say we were ""*moving in a different direction*.""  I nodded and said I'd do that as soon as possible.

After that, **$VPofIT**'s face brightened a bit.  He set all the paperwork to the side and asked me what I planned to do now.  After all, if we were getting rid of this developer and dismantling all the work they had done, what did I anticipate doing for this environment?

I told him that I wanted to move things into ArcGIS Online as our standard deployment platform.  I let him know about all the issues I'd considered with **$GiantCo**'s initial approach.  The main problem was that it would really require more technical skill and expertise on our part than the **$Facility** was willing to invest, and our users weren't going to sit down and learn to use ArcGIS Pro.  Instead of this, having abbreviated, catered apps and webmaps they could access through AGOL would be significantly easier (for everyone involved).  Moreover, I could get to work actually creating things almost from the get-go.  I logged in to AGOL and showed him some of the applications I'd already created, and he seemed to be very impressed.

I also brought up the security concerns surrounding this sort of environment.  I let him know that AGOL was now compliant with ***$SecurityPolicy***, and we went online to Esri's security page to confirm it.  I didn't point out that AGOL was only ""compliant"" rather than ""Certified"" or ""Authorized"" with this policy.  But whatever.  He didn't seem to catch on.  Discretion is the better part of valor, no?  Anyways, we kept talking about it; I showed him where we could set the log-in settings to where they would comply with all of the **$Facility**'s security requirements.  By the end of the conversation, he seemed convinced.

He gave me the ok to move forward standing up my entire environment within AGOL.  *Yeah!!!* success.png

As soon as I got back to my desk, I set up a meeting with everyone involved in this process, prefacing it as a discussion on the future of the enterprise environment.  Not a lie.  Two days later, I was back around the table with **$VPofIT**, **$Kathleen**, **$Scotty**, and tons of other IT folks.  **$GlamRock** was there, too, and he looked decidedly... *subdued*.  I told everyone the reason for us meeting today, and then got on Teams to talk to **$VacuumCorp**.

As soon as we got the Teams meeting started, the **$VacuumCorp** reps joined in, and I made some very perfunctory hellos.  The reps didn't seem to want to make small talk, this time.  There was no touting of their team's ability.  I got right to it.  I told them that we wanted to move in a different direction.  I wanted them to provide me with a change order that would include the costs of dismantling everything they had created for us, including disabling our Azure account and shutting down all services.  I would make sure they were paid as soon as I had confirmation that the entire system had been dismantled and turned off.

The **$VacuumCorp** reps didn't try to argue.  They all seemed to realize that they'd screwed up.  **$OverConfident**, the same guy that had told me months ago that his team was ""the absolute best in the world"" and all the rest of that self-aggrandizing fanfare, sort of looked down and nodded.  I told them that I expected their change order by this time next week, then said goodbye.  We shut the meeting off right afterwards.

I took a deep breath as I turned back to my fellow IT staff members.  **$Scotty** gave me a knowing smile.

>**$Scotty**: Brutal.

>**$Me**: Yep.  Had to be done though, you all know that.  First time I've ever fired a vendor, btw.

>**$Scotty**: It won't be the last.

>**$Me** (closing my eyes and rubbing my temples): Great.  Thanks for letting me know that.

Most of the rest of them laughed.  **$GlamRock** then piped up.  As mentioned, he had seemed very quiet throughout the meeting.  When he spoke, his voice wavered a little bit; I expect he'd gotten chewed out, big time, and that made me sad.  I hadn't set out to get him into trouble.  I liked that guy :(  Sometimes it has to happen, though.

>**$GlamRock** (quietly): Thanks for getting this set up.  Just let us know if you need something from us.  We'll help out however we can.

I smiled and thanked him.  Let bygones be bygones.

The next few weeks were a whirlwind of activity as we started shutting everything down.  I worked extensively with IT to make sure AGOL's procedures were set up appropriately and fit into their security model.  I got **$VacuumCorp**'s change order and had it approved in record time (the financial crunch probably helped that along).  We also got our Express Route decommissioned.  But even though we had **$VacuumCorp** actively tearing everything apart, it still took them almost two months before they had our environment turned off.

And all the while, I kept getting invoices from **$OverConfident** for the immense amounts required to support all this.  Well before **$VacuumCorp** had managed to get everything shut down, the charges had exhausted the entire annual budget I had in place for this.  I had to reach out to our finance ladies to make sure I could expense out the remainder when it got in.  I had made **$VacuumCorp** well aware that the price here was likely going to be outside my committed budget.  Yet they still kept hounding me.  Pretty sure that the different parts of their team weren't actually talking to one another.

After they'd sent me a particularly terse email, threatening me with turning off our Azure environment (to which my zero fscks would have been hand-delivered to them in a picnic basket), I followed up quickly with one of my own.  I was very clear in saying that I would not pay them until we got *ALL* of their final invoices, both for support of the system as well as development and closeout.  Moreover, I would not be sending payment until I received official confirmation from their dev team that everything had been turned off (and we were no longer financially responsible for anything else).  I left the threat unstated, but I think I was clear enough in intimating that if they decided to go down the legal route and sue us for unpaid invoices, I would go down the legal route *too* \- and our *extremely well-connected legal department* would sue them in turn for misrepresenting the circumstances of our contract.  I never heard a peep out of them threatening anything of the sort.

Despite that, they routinely sent me emails pretty much every week asking for payment.  Towards the end of the second month, I got an email from **$OverConfident** asking that I ""kindly remit payment"" for the invoices they'd sent out.  This was the first time I'd ever heard that sort of language on an email from a contractor.  And I've been on TFTS enough to know what that meant.  I mean, I would have preferred he say something like ""gimme my d4mn money, you b@stard"" - at least that would have been honest.  But that sort of passive-aggressive BS didn't fly with me.

I called him up only a few minutes after getting this email.  I told **$OverConfident** that I had been very clear on the conditions of payment in the last meeting I'd had with them.  Once they confirmed that they had sent all their invoices and that everything was shut down, I would submit all of this for payment - and not a moment sooner.  The longer they dragged out the decommissioning, the longer they would drag out getting reimbursed for it.  I think he got the point.

The next day, I got an email from one of **$VacuumCorp**'s finance people, **$FinanceLady**, with all the invoices that ""*she could find*"", along with a confirmation from the lead dev saying that everything was decommissioned.  I sent all this off to my finance department for payment.  Altogether, we coughed up about $60,000 for a completely useless service that we never once put into operation.

I wish that was the end of it, but it wasn't, of course.  I wound up hearing back from these people a few months later.

**$FinanceLady** contacted me out of the blue with a bunch of invoices.  She started out her email with something like ""Past Due: Please Remit Payment.""  There were several of them, totaling over $12,000 in charges.  I immediately fired back at her, asking what this was and why they had contacted us with more invoices.  Here is the exact wording from my email (with the names redacted):

>**$Me**: $FinanceLady, what is this and why do we have more charges from $VacuumCorp?  We canceled our business relationship with you in January.  Please advise.

I don't think that **$FinanceLady** expected this.  She immediately foisted me off to **$OverConfident**, asking if he could explain, and he was able to.  As it turned out, they had not sent me all the invoices they were supposed to earlier in the year (shocking), and Azure's payment schedule is two months in arrears, so there were still other payments that had come due in the time since.  All of this appeared to be legit as far as I could tell, even if they hadn't originally sent this to me in time (grumble).  I checked it with my finance team just to be sure.  Once I got their ok, I made sure everything got paid.

But I'm pretty sure I made an impression.

A couple of months later, **$FinanceLady** reached out to us yet again with another invoice she had lost.  However, this time, she didn't contact me.  She sent it to our IT team instead.  A few days after receiving it, **$Kathleen** got in touch with me, sending me the invoice and asking me:

>**$Kathleen**: Is this yours?

I laughed when I saw it.  Yes, it was mine.  But apparently I'd intimidated **$FinanceLady** so much that she didn't want to talk to me anymore.  Oh no.  Anyways...

With that, our enterprise environment was finally given its last rites and purged with fire.  I could now divert my attentions to other things - y'know, *real, actual work* \- plenty of which was waiting for me.

[Mr\_Cartographer's Atlas, Volume I](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/16u1gxn/mr_cartographers_atlas_volume_i/)",['azure'],tales from the facility part and the horse you rode in on hello again everyone this is my next story from the facility wherein we tell vacuumcorp precisely where to stick it all of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records and i have started taking notes specifically so i can write stories for tfts theres also a lot that comes from rumors gossip and other people but most of this is very recent so any inaccuracies are entirely on me also i dont give permission for anyone else to use this tldr well well well if it isnt the consequences of my actions we meet again for some context im not in it rather im a gis geographic information systems professional this particular world is quite small so i will do what i can to properly anonymize my tale however for reference all these stories take place at my new job working as the gis manager at the facility a major industrial entity in the american south heres my dramatis personae for this part me your friendly neighborhood gis guy distinguished vice president of engineering talented wellconnected opinionated and my direct boss he was honestly a very nice friendly person but i always found him a little intimidating glamrock primary server guy for the facility name taken from the fact that he was a legitimate rock star in the s now he works in it life amirite vpofit vice president of it extremely concerned about security and likes to get into the weeds but ultimately not a meanspirited manager giantco nationwide engineering firm that had convinced the facility to start a gis program ultimately a good company with highly skilled people but had a different idea of how to approach this than i did vaccuumcorp csp that was hired to start our cloud standup they sucked their name is a testament to their awfulness lol overconfident main rep from vacuumcorp cocky arrogant overpromising and ultimately kind of shady whoops looks like you got a little hubris on your face let me wipe that off for you ficelady a fice professional at vacuumcorp that proved to be quite scatterbrained and forgetful kept forgetting to follow up with us for payment when last we left off i had sought out an answer from the contracted company vacuumcorp building our cloudbased enterprise instance asking them why the cost for the system was grossly outside what we had agreed to pay for initially upon having a very heated conversation with them i realized they had not included the price for a missioncritical security protocol securitypolicy in our original estimates even though they had been informed repeatedly that it was necessary with this in mind the disgust i felt for them knew no bounds i wanted to break ties with this company and scrap this entire project to go in a different direction but my boss distinguished told me that i had to have vpofits approval before doing so so today i was dolled up walking into a oneonone meeting with vpofit to ask precisely that let me say that i was quite nervous here i had spoken to vpofit plenty in the time leading up and i could even go so far as to say we had been friendly but he was very high up the food chain and i was about to talk to him about some very serious crp this wasnt us shooting the sht over what gis could do as wed done previously i made sure to have my documentation my laptop and everything else id need and i also spent way too much time fixing my tie and my collar in the mirror in the bathroom it probably wasnt necessary oh well anyways i waited in the conference room for him and pretty much right on time he walked in and we got to talking i laid out the situation our vendor vacuumcorp appeared to have been dealing with us in bad faith this was evidenced by them omitting the cost of securitypolicy from our estimates then lying to me that they didnt know about it when i asked them i wanted to drop them as a vendor vpofit wrinkled his brow and asked me what evidence i had that they knew about this policy i pulled out the scope of work document id gotten in january almost a year before it had been signed by our it server team and i thought that this was the actual sow that we were actively working under on the second page of that document it clearly referenced securitypolicy as one of terms of the agreement i passed it over to vpofit he read it frowning a minute or so later he looked up at me vpofit i see that this is signed by our server team did you ever get a copy back from vacuumcorp signed on their end me no i figured that you all were just giving me the document during one stage of the signing process and yall would keep the executed version in the it recordkeeping system vpofit i see looks like somebody didnt do their homework do you remember all that mess we went through getting the terms and conditions approved for your cost estimates last summer me clearly remembering that clusterfsck yes yes i remember all too well vpofit thats because that document was the actual sow that we are operating under not this holding up the paperwork i had given him doesnt excuse vacuumcorp from not knowing about securitypolicy as it is still clearly listed on a document they wrote as part of this project but check this out vpofit proceeded to rip the last three pages of the document from where id stapled them together and passed them to me they were the terms and conditions for this sow ones that i had never reviewed because i never thought id had to the it server team had been the ones to get this document theyd signed it before id even had a chance to look at it i had assumed theyd done their due diligence whenever doing so vpofit notice anything me reading over the document a sinking realization coming into my mind this this is the same set of terms that we had for the estimates last summer the ones from before we sent this off for legal review it has a bunch of things that we took out and a bunch of things that are not enforceable or even legal vpofit pissed yep youre dmn right unbeknownst to me i had opened an entirely new can of worms i hadnt expected this at all as mentioned i thought that the it server team had done their due diligence whenever signing contracts and things like that but as it turns out they hadnt they hadnt at all the sow we were looking at happened to be the first draft of the contract between us and vacuumcorp the server team glamrock in particular had signed it without even looking at it it held a ton of provisions that would have gotten us into immense trouble and could have resulted in hundreds of thousands even millions in damages on top of this they werent even the folks authorized to sign this in the first place incredibly theyd never sent this on to vacuumcorp but had they done so and had vacuumcorp countersigned this agreement would have become actionable and we would have been on the hook for all this mess i had no idea vpofit was livid the quiet type of livid that means some sht is about to go down eventually he took a deep sigh and calmed himself he said he would take care of this on his end he then said to me absolutely we could get rid of this vendor vacuumcorp he told me to call them up and tell them that we were terminating the agreement i was insanely relieved to hear this but id also never fired a vendor before after continuing for a moment i asked a candid question me so uh ive never fired a vendor before how um exactly do i do that for the first time all meeting vpofit smiled he sort of chuckled when he said for me to call them and say we were moving in a different direction i nodded and said id do that as soon as possible after that vpofits face brightened a bit he set all the paperwork to the side and asked me what i planned to do now after all if we were getting rid of this developer and dismantling all the work they had done what did i anticipate doing for this environment i told him that i wanted to move things into arcgis online as our standard deployment platform i let him know about all the issues id considered with giantcos initial approach the main problem was that it would really require more technical skill and expertise on our part than the facility was willing to invest and our users werent going to sit down and learn to use arcgis pro instead of this having abbreviated catered apps and webmaps they could access through agol would be significantly easier for everyone involved moreover i could get to work actually creating things almost from the getgo i logged in to agol and showed him some of the applications id already created and he seemed to be very impressed i also brought up the security concerns surrounding this sort of environment i let him know that agol was now compliant with securitypolicy and we went online to esris security page to confirm it i didnt point out that agol was only compliant rather than certified or authorized with this policy but whatever he didnt seem to catch on discretion is the better part of valor no anyways we kept talking about it i showed him where we could set the login settings to where they would comply with all of the facilitys security requirements by the end of the conversation he seemed convinced he gave me the ok to move forward standing up my entire environment within agol yeah successpng as soon as i got back to my desk i set up a meeting with everyone involved in this process prefacing it as a discussion on the future of the enterprise environment not a lie two days later i was back around the table with vpofit kathleen scotty and tons of other it folks glamrock was there too and he looked decidedly subdued i told everyone the reason for us meeting today and then got on teams to talk to vacuumcorp as soon as we got the teams meeting started the vacuumcorp reps joined in and i made some very perfunctory hellos the reps didnt seem to want to make small talk this time there was no touting of their teams ability i got right to it i told them that we wanted to move in a different direction i wanted them to provide me with a change order that would include the costs of dismantling everything they had created for us including disabling our azure account and shutting down all services i would make sure they were paid as soon as i had confirmation that the entire system had been dismantled and turned off the vacuumcorp reps didnt try to argue they all seemed to realize that theyd screwed up overconfident the same guy that had told me months ago that his team was the absolute best in the world and all the rest of that selfaggrandizing fanfare sort of looked down and nodded i told them that i expected their change order by this time next week then said goodbye we shut the meeting off right afterwards i took a deep breath as i turned back to my fellow it staff members scotty gave me a knowing smile scotty brutal me yep had to be done though you all know that first time ive ever fired a vendor btw scotty it wont be the last me closing my eyes and rubbing my temples great thanks for letting me know that most of the rest of them laughed glamrock then piped up as mentioned he had seemed very quiet throughout the meeting when he spoke his voice wavered a little bit i expect hed gotten chewed out big time and that made me sad i hadnt set out to get him into trouble i liked that guy sometimes it has to happen though glamrock quietly thanks for getting this set up just let us know if you need something from us well help out however we can i smiled and thanked him let bygones be bygones the next few weeks were a whirlwind of activity as we started shutting everything down i worked extensively with it to make sure agols procedures were set up appropriately and fit into their security model i got vacuumcorps change order and had it approved in record time the ficial crunch probably helped that along we also got our express route decommissioned but even though we had vacuumcorp actively tearing everything apart it still took them almost two months before they had our environment turned off and all the while i kept getting invoices from overconfident for the immense amounts required to support all this well before vacuumcorp had managed to get everything shut down the charges had exhausted the entire annual budget i had in place for this i had to reach out to our fice ladies to make sure i could expense out the remainder when it got in i had made vacuumcorp well aware that the price here was likely going to be outside my committed budget yet they still kept hounding me pretty sure that the different parts of their team werent actually talking to one another after theyd sent me a particularly terse email threatening me with turning off our azure environment to which my zero fscks would have been handdelivered to them in a picnic basket i followed up quickly with one of my own i was very clear in saying that i would not pay them until we got all of their final invoices both for support of the system as well as development and closeout moreover i would not be sending payment until i received official confirmation from their dev team that everything had been turned off and we were no longer ficially responsible for anything else i left the threat unstated but i think i was clear enough in intimating that if they decided to go down the legal route and sue us for unpaid invoices i would go down the legal route too and our extremely wellconnected legal department would sue them in turn for misrepresenting the circumstances of our contract i never heard a peep out of them threatening anything of the sort despite that they routinely sent me emails pretty much every week asking for payment towards the end of the second month i got an email from overconfident asking that i kindly remit payment for the invoices theyd sent out this was the first time id ever heard that sort of language on an email from a contractor and ive been on tfts enough to know what that meant i mean i would have preferred he say something like gimme my dmn money you bstard at least that would have been honest but that sort of passiveaggressive bs didnt fly with me i called him up only a few minutes after getting this email i told overconfident that i had been very clear on the conditions of payment in the last meeting id had with them once they confirmed that they had sent all their invoices and that everything was shut down i would submit all of this for payment and not a moment sooner the longer they dragged out the decommissioning the longer they would drag out getting reimbursed for it i think he got the point the next day i got an email from one of vacuumcorps fice people ficelady with all the invoices that she could find along with a confirmation from the lead dev saying that everything was decommissioned i sent all this off to my fice department for payment altogether we coughed up about for a completely useless service that we never once put into operation i wish that was the end of it but it wasnt of course i wound up hearing back from these people a few months later ficelady contacted me out of the blue with a bunch of invoices she started out her email with something like past due please remit payment there were several of them totaling over in charges i immediately fired back at her asking what this was and why they had contacted us with more invoices here is the exact wording from my email with the names redacted me ficelady what is this and why do we have more charges from vacuumcorp we canceled our business relationship with you in january please advise i dont think that ficelady expected this she immediately foisted me off to overconfident asking if he could explain and he was able to as it turned out they had not sent me all the invoices they were supposed to earlier in the year shocking and azures payment schedule is two months in arrears so there were still other payments that had come due in the time since all of this appeared to be legit as far as i could tell even if they hadnt originally sent this to me in time grumble i checked it with my fice team just to be sure once i got their ok i made sure everything got paid but im pretty sure i made an impression a couple of months later ficelady reached out to us yet again with another invoice she had lost however this time she didnt contact me she sent it to our it team instead a few days after receiving it kathleen got in touch with me sending me the invoice and asking me kathleen is this yours i laughed when i saw it yes it was mine but apparently id intimidated ficelady so much that she didnt want to talk to me anymore oh no anyways with that our enterprise environment was finally given its last rites and purged with fire i could now divert my attentions to other things yknow real

1lth6v5,Tech,talesfromtechsupport,"Tales from the $Facility: Part 6 - Revelations Hey y'all!  This is my next story from the **$Facility**, where I search to figure out what the h3ll happened when our new enterprise environment wound up costing us grossly more than expected.  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records (and I have started taking notes specifically so I can write stories for TFTS!)  There's also a lot that comes from rumors, gossip, and other people, but most of this is very recent, so any inaccuracies are entirely on me.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.

TL/DR: It would be so much more fulfilling if a liar's pants actually did catch on fire.

For some context, I'm not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional.  This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale.  However, for reference, all these stories take place at my new job working as the GIS Manager at the **$Facility**, a major industrial entity in the American South.  Here's my Dramatis Personae for this part:

* **$Me**: Your friendly neighborhood GIS guy.
* **$Distinguished**: Vice President of Engineering.  Talented, well-connected, opinionated, and my direct boss.  He was honestly a very nice, friendly person, but I always found him a little intimidating.
* **$GlamRock**: Primary server guy for the $Facility.  Name taken from the fact that he was a legitimate rock star in the 1980s.  Now he works in IT.  Life, amirite?
* **$VPofIT**: Vice President of IT.  Extremely concerned about security and likes to get into the weeds, but ultimately not a mean-spirited manager.
* **$GiantCo**: Nationwide engineering firm that had convinced the $Facility to start a GIS program.  Ultimately a good company with highly skilled people, but had a different idea of how to approach this than I did.
* **$VaccuumCorp**: CSP that was hired to start our cloud standup.  They sucked.  Their name is a testament to their awfulness.  Lol.
* **$OverConfident**: Main rep from $VacuumCorp.  Cocky, arrogant, overpromising, and ultimately kind of shady.  Whoops, looks like you got a little hubris on your face, let me wipe that off for you.

When last we left off, we had finally completed the cloud-based environment that would serve as the foundation for our GIS Enterprise Environment going forward.  Just before we were to have **$GiantCo** begin building things, however, I had received an invoice from **$VacuumCorp** that was *outrageously* high - over *four times* what we had originally agreed to pay, with the insinuation that the price would only go *UP* from there.  I was in crisis mode now - we would exhaust our available funding for this in only a few months, and I needed to figure out what was going on so that I could rein these costs back in.

I started out by speaking to my boss, **$Distinguished**.  I had checked with the company to see if this had included the dev costs, and apparently it didn't.  I asked him if we could afford to pay this.  Predictably, he said no.  I told him that I would look into why these costs were so high.  I had a meeting scheduled with **$VacuumCorp** in a few days, so I would try to find out then and rein this back to a reasonable number.  And if I couldn't get the costs reduced, I'd look into disabling everything for the time being.  If we couldn't find a way to overcome this, I'd even consider shutting everything down altogether.  **$Distinguished** agreed with me and left me to my devices.

As I got prepped for the upcoming call, I thought about where this extra cost may have been coming from.  One thing that immediately came to mind was the security protocols that we had placed on our Azure instance.  If you'll recall, me and the IT Server Team had requested that this be set up with a specific, high-level governmental protocol called ***$SecurityPolicy*** in a previous story.  This policy has varying level of protection that it can be configured for; the one we required was the middling grade.  Well, over the summer, I had gotten a federal grant to assist me in constructing an even-more-secure GIS architecture.  I'd asked **$OverConfident** if they could upgrade the settings on ***$SecurityPolicy*** to the *highest* grade, instead of the middle one.  I asked if doing so would result in an increased support cost, and his response was:

>**$OverConfident**: It shouldn't, this is just a configuration change.  The *support cost for hosting your data* should remain the same.

Ok, so let's rewind a bit.  See what I highlighted in **$OverConfident**'s diatribe?  ""*Support cost for hosting your data.*""  Y'all, I should have known better.  But at the time, I was still very inexperienced at all this stuff.  I should have known that ""support cost for hosting your data"" != ""support cost of the entire system.""  <sigh>  Let's get back to it :(

Anyways, back in the present, I participated on the call with **$VacuumCorps** a few days later and asked where the extra costs were coming from.  Eventually, I brought up that I thought this high level of ***$SecurityPolicy*** might be where the issues were originating from.  I asked them to check that for me, and if this was the case, to reduce our security settings back down to the middle level.  **$OverConfident** assured me that he'd get right on that.

A few days later, I got an email from him.  Yes, the security settings were exactly where these extra costs were coming from.  I was pretty pissed that they had never said anything to me about this, particularly when I'd directly asked earlier in the year.  However, I was also exhausted and disillusioned with this whole process, and I just wanted to get through it.  I told the reps at **$VacuumCorp** to reduce our security settings back down to the middling level.  That, I hoped, would get rid of all this extra cost.  Then, I sat back and waited.  For a couple of weeks, I waited.

Out of the blue, about three weeks later, I got another email from **$OverConfident**.  He stated that reducing our security back down to the middling level would not result in any appreciable cost savings.  ***$SecurityPolicy*** had a number of requirements that, by default, we had to spend an immense amount to cover.  As such, even if we reduced our security level, we would still be on the hook for all this, though he said we could likely pull the spend down to *""less than five figures per month.""*

Which was still almost ***5x*** what we had agreed to spend on this system when we first signed the support agreement with them.

I was *floored*.  Where in the h3ll had this been when we were setting up things to start with!?  If what **$OverConfident** was telling me was accurate, then they had known all this extra cost would be part of our rollout, yet just didn't tell me about it until we actually had things set up!  I saw *none* of this in the original estimates!  *WTF?!?!*

I immediately set up another call with **$VacuumCorp**.  I told them in the invite that I didn't know if we could pay for this as it had not been approved.  I also wanted to get some answers from them to provide to my leadership.  The next day, I was in the conference room with **$GlamRock** and several others.  As soon as **$OverConfident** and the others logged on, they attempted to engage in some pleasantries, but I shut that sh!t down immediately.  I went straight for the jugular.

>**$Me**: We're here to discuss the support cost for the Azure environment that you created for us.  When I received the agreement from you all last spring, it had a spend of roughly $2,000 per month, based on usage.  However, from what I have seen now, the monthly cost is between 4-5 times that.  You have stated that the excess cost is due to the security parameters that were required in this environment due to adhering to *$SecurityPolicy*.  What is going on?  Why was this not provided in the original cost estimate that you provided to us?

>**$OverConfident**: Well, we didn't know that you wanted to implement *$SecurityPolicy* for this environment.  It wasn't in our Scope of Work, so we didn't include costs associated with it in our estimates.

At that point, my jaw dropped.  Very quickly, though, my shock turned to outright anger.  I'm sorry, I raised my voice.

>**$Me**: *Are you kidding me!?!?*  You *knew* that this protocol had to be in place for this system!  We've been discussing this with you from the very beginning!  It was on the Scope of Work we received back in January - the same one that *YOU WROTE!*

I have very rarely gotten directly angry to anyone in any professional capacity.  But this was different - these idiots, lying directly to my face, swelling an anticipated cost up this much and expecting me to just live with it?  When I had to try to argue and beg and plead with my finance people to pay for it?  Undermining my credibility - *and my discipline's credibility* \- to the others invested in this process all along the way?  Aww, ***H3LL*** *No*.  Not going to fly, kid.

>**$Me**: How *on earth* did you think that we wouldn't need this to be part of our rollout?!?

>**$OverConfident**: <silence>

After a moment, I just shook my head, leaned back in my chair, and gathered my things from the conference table.

>**$Me**: I need to have a discussion with my leadership.  $GlamRock, everyone, if you want to continue this call, you are welcome to.  I have things to take care of.  Goodbye.

And I got up and left the fscking room.  I know that **$GlamRock** and the others continued to speak, but I was done in there.

I was *livid* when I got back to my desk.  Just to be certain, I pulled up the original SOW that I had received back at the beginning of the year.  This was the one that I thought we were operating under, the one that was signed by my server team.  Sure enough, as I perused the document, I found (on the second page) the following quote:

>Azure enterprise development will abide by ***$SecurityPolicy*** auditing protocols.

So there it was, black and white, clear as crystal.  100% proof that what **$OverConfident** had told me was patently not true - they had known about this for almost a year now.  And they had, by omission or otherwise, kept it out of the cost estimate they had provided to me in April.

I walked around the headquarters building a few times to cool off and clear my head.

When I got back inside, I had come to a few conclusions.  First off, I was *DONE* working with **$VacuumCorp**.  They had failed to represent (or misrepresented) a major element about this environment to me, and I wasn't going to let that slide.  Moreover, from what I was seeing now, the cost associated with having ***$SecurityPolicy*** set up for this cloud environment was beyond me and my department's means.  This essentially meant that I couldn't stand this up *at all*.  I could try to roll out an on-prem solution instead, but that would mean that all the time, effort, and money already spent was now wasted.  And I still had reservations about how an on-prem solution would work anyway.  And honestly, I was just extremely disillusioned towards going down this path at all now, considering the experiences that I'd just had.

*And I had an ace up my sleeve.*

Over the past summer, I had gotten tired of waiting for my various contractors to get their sh!t together and actually do something.  So I started doing some minor development in ArcGIS Online.  Nothing big, just a few simple webmaps without sensitive data, and a spatial record-keeping system for one of our departments that was having difficulty rectifying some things.

For those of you that don't know, ArcGIS Online (or AGOL) is the Esri-managed online enterprise system that they provide to anyone that purchases licenses of their software.  You don't have as much control over it compared to ArcGIS Enterprise and there are certain solutions that don't work in it, but it can be used as a solid development/production space if you use it right.  Moreover you effectively don't need to pay anything extra for it.  Best of all, you don't have to do anything to maintain the software.  No server maintenance or any of that cr4p that I never remotely considered when I obtained my *geography* degree.

And a few weeks prior, some of my colleagues at **$GiantCo** had informed me that AGOL was now ***$SecurityPolicy***\-compliant.  Not certified or authorized, merely ""*compliant*"".  Whatever helps you sleep at night, Esri.  Anyways, if this truly were the case, I could stand up our entire environment in AGOL and scrap the whole enterprise system we had been building entirely.  It would cost us way less money in the long run, save me a lot of grief, remove our IT Server Team from the process entirely, and have me be able to work on development almost immediately.  Lots of win.

Unfortunately, this would also mean that everything we had invested into this implementation would be wasted.  A lot to consider...

After contemplating it a bit more, I made up my mind.  We needed to scrap this contractor, scrap this workflow, scrap the enterprise environment, scrap all we had been working on for the time being.  I got up from my desk and headed over to **$Distinguished**'s office.  I asked him for a bit of time, then sat down around the conference table he had there and laid out everything.  After hearing about the problems here, my concerns, and my new thought of using AGOL to fix things, **$Distinguished** was convinced.  However, he said for me to go speak to **$VPofIT** about it.  Since this was a major system change revolving around tech development/support, he wanted **$VPofIT**'s approval before we made any move.  I agreed to do so.

I set up a meeting with **$VPofIT** for the next afternoon.  I tried to paraphrase what I was asking for, but I made sure that he knew this was a discussion about dropping **$VacuumCorp**.  **$VPofIT** accepted the meeting invite, but also requested that I send him every major piece of documentation that I had for this project.  So I did so.  And I was actually quite nervous about all this, too.  **$VPofIT** basically held the reins for anything regarding tech here at the **$Facility**.  He could tell me that they didn't want to move forward with anything in AGOL, for a variety of reasons.  He could tell me that they didn't want to waste everything we'd invested in getting this other solution stood up, and I needed to suck it up and work with them.  He could tell me a lot of things.  I wasn't sure how this conversation would go, not by a long shot.  A swarm of butterflies were dancing in my stomach as I went home that night...

The next day, I showed up dressed nicely, steeling myself for one of the most consequential meetings of my professional career...

You'll see how that went tomorrow.  Later, y'all!

[Mr\_Cartographer's Atlas, Volume I](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/16u1gxn/mr_cartographers_atlas_volume_i/)",['azure'],tales from the facility part revelations hey yall this is my next story from the facility where i search to figure out what the hll happened when our new enterprise environment wound up costing us grossly more than expected all of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records and i have started taking notes specifically so i can write stories for tfts theres also a lot that comes from rumors gossip and other people but most of this is very recent so any inaccuracies are entirely on me also i dont give permission for anyone else to use this tldr it would be so much more fulfilling if a liars pants actually did catch on fire for some context im not in it rather im a gis geographic information systems professional this particular world is quite small so i will do what i can to properly anonymize my tale however for reference all these stories take place at my new job working as the gis manager at the facility a major industrial entity in the american south heres my dramatis personae for this part me your friendly neighborhood gis guy distinguished vice president of engineering talented wellconnected opinionated and my direct boss he was honestly a very nice friendly person but i always found him a little intimidating glamrock primary server guy for the facility name taken from the fact that he was a legitimate rock star in the s now he works in it life amirite vpofit vice president of it extremely concerned about security and likes to get into the weeds but ultimately not a meanspirited manager giantco nationwide engineering firm that had convinced the facility to start a gis program ultimately a good company with highly skilled people but had a different idea of how to approach this than i did vaccuumcorp csp that was hired to start our cloud standup they sucked their name is a testament to their awfulness lol overconfident main rep from vacuumcorp cocky arrogant overpromising and ultimately kind of shady whoops looks like you got a little hubris on your face let me wipe that off for you when last we left off we had finally completed the cloudbased environment that would serve as the foundation for our gis enterprise environment going forward just before we were to have giantco begin building things however i had received an invoice from vacuumcorp that was outrageously high over four times what we had originally agreed to pay with the insinuation that the price would only go up from there i was in crisis mode now we would exhaust our available funding for this in only a few months and i needed to figure out what was going on so that i could rein these costs back in i started out by speaking to my boss distinguished i had checked with the company to see if this had included the dev costs and apparently it didnt i asked him if we could afford to pay this predictably he said no i told him that i would look into why these costs were so high i had a meeting scheduled with vacuumcorp in a few days so i would try to find out then and rein this back to a reasonable number and if i couldnt get the costs reduced id look into disabling everything for the time being if we couldnt find a way to overcome this id even consider shutting everything down altogether distinguished agreed with me and left me to my devices as i got prepped for the upcoming call i thought about where this extra cost may have been coming from one thing that immediately came to mind was the security protocols that we had placed on our azure instance if youll recall me and the it server team had requested that this be set up with a specific highlevel governmental protocol called securitypolicy in a previous story this policy has varying level of protection that it can be configured for the one we required was the middling grade well over the summer i had gotten a federal grant to assist me in constructing an evenmoresecure gis architecture id asked overconfident if they could upgrade the settings on securitypolicy to the highest grade instead of the middle one i asked if doing so would result in an increased support cost and his response was overconfident it shouldnt this is just a configuration change the support cost for hosting your data should remain the same ok so lets rewind a bit see what i highlighted in overconfidents diatribe support cost for hosting your data yall i should have known better but at the time i was still very inexperienced at all this stuff i should have known that support cost for hosting your data support cost of the entire system sigh lets get back to it anyways back in the present i participated on the call with vacuumcorps a few days later and asked where the extra costs were coming from eventually i brought up that i thought this high level of securitypolicy might be where the issues were originating from i asked them to check that for me and if this was the case to reduce our security settings back down to the middle level overconfident assured me that hed get right on that a few days later i got an email from him yes the security settings were exactly where these extra costs were coming from i was pretty pissed that they had never said anything to me about this particularly when id directly asked earlier in the year however i was also exhausted and disillusioned with this whole process and i just wanted to get through it i told the reps at vacuumcorp to reduce our security settings back down to the middling level that i hoped would get rid of all this extra cost then i sat back and waited for a couple of weeks i waited out of the blue about three weeks later i got another email from overconfident he stated that reducing our security back down to the middling level would not result in any appreciable cost savings securitypolicy had a number of requirements that by default we had to spend an immense amount to cover as such even if we reduced our security level we would still be on the hook for all this though he said we could likely pull the spend down to less than five figures per month which was still almost x what we had agreed to spend on this system when we first signed the support agreement with them i was floored where in the hll had this been when we were setting up things to start with if what overconfident was telling me was accurate then they had known all this extra cost would be part of our rollout yet just didnt tell me about it until we actually had things set up i saw none of this in the original estimates wtf i immediately set up another call with vacuumcorp i told them in the invite that i didnt know if we could pay for this as it had not been approved i also wanted to get some answers from them to provide to my leadership the next day i was in the conference room with glamrock and several others as soon as overconfident and the others logged on they attempted to engage in some pleasantries but i shut that sht down immediately i went straight for the jugular me were here to discuss the support cost for the azure environment that you created for us when i received the agreement from you all last spring it had a spend of roughly per month based on usage however from what i have seen now the monthly cost is between times that you have stated that the excess cost is due to the security parameters that were required in this environment due to adhering to securitypolicy what is going on why was this not provided in the original cost estimate that you provided to us overconfident well we didnt know that you wanted to implement securitypolicy for this environment it wasnt in our scope of work so we didnt include costs associated with it in our estimates at that point my jaw dropped very quickly though my shock turned to outright anger im sorry i raised my voice me are you kidding me you knew that this protocol had to be in place for this system weve been discussing this with you from the very beginning it was on the scope of work we received back in january the same one that you wrote i have very rarely gotten directly angry to anyone in any professional capacity but this was different these idiots lying directly to my face swelling an anticipated cost up this much and expecting me to just live with it when i had to try to argue and beg and plead with my fice people to pay for it undermining my credibility and my disciplines credibility to the others invested in this process all along the way aww hll no not going to fly kid me how on earth did you think that we wouldnt need this to be part of our rollout overconfident silence after a moment i just shook my head leaned back in my chair and gathered my things from the conference table me i need to have a discussion with my leadership glamrock everyone if you want to continue this call you are welcome to i have things to take care of goodbye and i got up and left the fscking room i know that glamrock and the others continued to speak but i was done in there i was livid when i got back to my desk just to be certain i pulled up the original sow that i had received back at the beginning of the year this was the one that i thought we were operating under the one that was signed by my server team sure enough as i perused the document i found on the second page the following quote azure enterprise development will abide by securitypolicy auditing protocols so there it was black and white clear as crystal proof that what overconfident had told me was patently not true they had known about this for almost a year now and they had by omission or otherwise kept it out of the cost estimate they had provided to me in april i walked around the headquarters building a few times to cool off and clear my head when i got back inside i had come to a few conclusions first off i was done working with vacuumcorp they had failed to represent or misrepresented a major element about this environment to me and i wasnt going to let that slide moreover from what i was seeing now the cost associated with having securitypolicy set up for this cloud environment was beyond me and my departments means this essentially meant that i couldnt stand this up at all i could try to roll out an onprem solution instead but that would mean that all the time effort and money already spent was now wasted and i still had reservations about how an onprem solution would work anyway and honestly i was just extremely disillusioned towards going down this path at all now considering the experiences that id just had and i had an ace up my sleeve over the past summer i had gotten tired of waiting for my various contractors to get their sht together and actually do something so i started doing some minor development in arcgis online nothing big just a few simple webmaps without sensitive data and a spatial recordkeeping system for one of our departments that was having difficulty rectifying some things for those of you that dont know arcgis online or agol is the esrimanaged online enterprise system that they provide to anyone that purchases licenses of their software you dont have as much control over it compared to arcgis enterprise and there are certain solutions that dont work in it but it can be used as a solid developmentproduction space if you use it right moreover you effectively dont need to pay anything extra for it best of all you dont have to do anything to maintain the software no server maintece or any of that crp that i never remotely considered when i obtained my geography degree and a few weeks prior some of my colleagues at giantco had informed me that agol was now securitypolicycompliant not certified or authorized merely compliant whatever helps you sleep at night esri anyways if this truly were the case i could stand up our entire environment in agol and scrap the whole enterprise system we had been building entirely it would cost us way less money in the long run save me a lot of grief remove our it server team from the process entirely and have me be able to work on development almost immediately lots of win unfortunately this would also mean that everything we had invested into this implementation would be wasted a lot to consider after contemplating it a bit more i made up my mind we needed to scrap this contractor scrap this workflow scrap the enterprise environment scrap all we had been working on for the time being i got up from my desk and headed over to distinguisheds office i asked him for a bit of time then sat down around the conference table he had there and laid out everything after hearing about the problems here my concerns and my new thought of using agol to fix things distinguished was convinced however he said for me to go speak to vpofit about it since this was a major system change revolving around tech developmentsupport he wanted vpofits approval before we made any move i agreed to do so i set up a meeting with vpofit for the next afternoon i tried to paraphrase what i was asking for but i made sure that he knew this was a discussion about dropping vacuumcorp vpofit accepted the meeting invite but also requested that i send him every major piece of documentation that i had for this project so i did so and i was

1lsp1ek,Tech,talesfromtechsupport,"Tales from the $Facility: Part 5 - Points of Failure Hello again, everyone!  This is my next story from the **$Facility**, where we find out the points of failure in our approach to get a GIS enterprise environment.  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records (and I have started taking notes specifically so I can write stories for TFTS!)  There's also a lot that comes from rumors, gossip, and other people, but most of this is very recent, so any inaccuracies are entirely on me.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.

TL/DR: *""Bluescreen has performed an illegal operation.  Bluescreen must be closed.""*  You failed at failing.

For some context, I'm not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional.  This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale.  However, for reference, all these stories take place at my new job working as the GIS Manager at the $Facility, a major industrial entity in the American South.  Here's my Dramatis Personae for this part:

* **$Me**: Your friendly neighborhood GIS guy.
* **$Tuckman**: Drone pilot that works for the maintenance department.  Extremely awesome guy, has taught me a lot.
* **$Distinguished**: Vice President of Engineering.  Talented, well-connected, opinionated, and my direct boss.  He was honestly a very nice, friendly person, but I always found him a little intimidating.
* **$GlamRock**: Primary server guy for the $Facility.  Name taken from the fact that he was a legitimate rock star in the 1980s.  Now he works in IT.  Life, amirite?
* **$Kathleen**: Fearless leader of the IT support team.  Super sweet lady, she's the best.
* **$Scotty**: One of the primary techs on the IT support team.  Really nice dude (I mean, all of the IT team is nice), but there are elements about GIS that he still has to learn.
* **$GiantCo**: Nationwide engineering firm that had convinced the $Facility to start a GIS program.  Ultimately a good company with highly skilled people, but had a different idea of how to approach this than I did.
* **$VaccuumCorp**: CSP that was hired to start our cloud standup.  They sucked.  Their name is a testament to their awfulness.  Lol.
* **$OverConfident**: Main rep from $VacuumCorp.  Cocky, arrogant, overpromising, and ultimately kind of shady.  Whoops, looks like you got a little hubris on your face, let me wipe that off for you.

**Interlude - Aerial Maneuvers**

>**$Me**: That's not going to scan the whole machine.  You need to increase the flight perimeter distance.

I was in the middle of a drone flight mission near the center of our primary campus, along with **$Tuckman** (the main drone admin at the time).  We were scanning one of the massive pieces of machinery that we operated there.  The drone's RTK was having a lot of trouble getting a good satellite signal what with all the metal around us, but we'd finally found a spot where it could connect.  We were going to perform a perimeter scan where the drone would take photos at three different elevation tiers, then we could stitch the images together to create a fully 3D model that I could import into GIS.  If that sounds like fscking sci-fi magic, that's because it is.

Anyways, **$Tuckman** was the PIC (Pilot In Command), while I was the flight operator.  We were using an Esri product to manage the flight, and I had the flight planning app open on an iPad.  **$Tuckman** had set up the original perimeter distance.  However, as I looked at the screen, everything appeared to be shallow on the western side.  I walked over with the iPad to show him.

>**$Tuckman** (looking at the app and frowning): No, it looks fine to me.

>**$Me**: Look here (pointing to the western side of the flight plan).  See?  The distance you have here is about half what we have on the eastern side.  If we fly at this distance, we'll wind up failing to capture the western side of the machine, and our 3D model won't be accurate.

>**$Tuckman**: I think it'll be fine.  We got enough clearance for everything.

>**$Me**: But we still don't have a *lot* of clearance.  Remember our other scans?  When we sent our photos off for processing, it missed a ton of data directly under the drone.  I really think we should back the perimeter up a little bit, at least make it even on all sides.

>**$Tuckman** (uncertain): Y'know, I ain't sure...

>**$Me** (being an a$$ and changing the flight mission settings): ...here we go.  Take a look here.  I backed everything up, and it doesn't cross over any of the trackpaths for any of our other machinery out here.  We should be good with this, I would think.

>**$Tuckman**: Whatever you say.  If the drone gets damaged, it's coming out of your budget.

>**$Me**: Fair enough.

**$Tuckman** then turned the drone on.  We connected everything; the app took control of the device, got it in the air, and sent it on its way.  We really didn't have to do anything from here except watch.  The drone flew up to 250 feet above the surface and begin flying in a perimeter around the machine.  Everything seemed to be going well.

A few minutes later, it lowered to 200 feet.  As it did so... I noticed something.  One of the other massive machines from further away was trolleying towards us.  I had made sure the flight path didn't overlap its trackway.  But now that I could see it better, I could tell that there was a bunch of superstructure hanging off of it towards the top, overhanging the track...

I got a sinking feeling in my stomach.

The drone lowered down to 150 feet.  It started to fly the perimeter.  And it looked like it was dangerously close to intersecting this machine...

>**$Me**: Hey, uh, $Tuckman?  How high is the housing up there?

>**$Tuckman** (staring at me, deadpan): 160 feet.

>**$Me**: Sh!t.

The device starting flying ever closer to the superstructure.  My heart started sinking further.

>**$Me**: Um, that thing is getting crazy close.  Can we stop it?

>**$Tuckman** (looking down at the RC): Not from here.  The iPad has control, and unless you cancel the mission, it won't do anything.

>**$Me**: Sh!t!

I looked at the iPad, but it wasn't allowing me to interact with anything!  I think it was locked up, actually - it was very hot outside.  I turned to **$Tuckman**, a bit of despair in my voice.

>**$Me**: It won't let me cancel the mission! \*shaking head\*

**$Tuckman** turned to look at the drone, which was now making its final turn into the approach towards the machine.

>**$Tuckman**: Sh!t!

It kept getting closer, and closer, and closer!

>**$Me** and **$Tuckman**: *Sh!t sh!t sh!t sh!t sh!t sh!t sh!t!!!*

Its path finally crossed the machine itself!  Straight beneath the housing!  Feet, maybe *inches*, away from the superstructure!

>**$Both**: *SSSSSSHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIIII............!!!!!!*

*And then it flew past.*

**$Tuckman** let out an audible sigh of relief.  I stumbled backwards, settling back on the bed of the truck we'd driven out there.  After taking things in for a few more seconds, watching the drone as it headed back to its home point, **$Tuckman** turned to me with a half-sarcastic, half-exasperated look on his face.

>**$Tuckman**: D4mmit, boy!  Next time I take you flying, you better bring an extra pair of britches with you!

I laughed, as much from the nervous consolation that I wouldn't have to pay for a $50,000 drone out of my GIS budget as from anything else.  Almost immediately afterwards, the iPad overheated (it's fscking hot here, y'all) and we had to cut out any other flights for the day.  I don't think either of us would have been up for it anyways.

But I've always made sure to bring an extra pair of brown pants in the truck for any flights I've done ever since.  Just in case.  *Lol :D*

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Back to the Story**

When last we left off, I had been trying to get my contractors and staff to construct our cloud-based GIS enterprise environment for me.  It had been fraught with issues; we had spent about a year building things so far, and each month resulted in multiple steps forward and multiple steps back.  Most recently, we had attempted a kickoff meeting, only to discover that a major component (that had been told repeatedly to the subcontractor, **$VacuumCorp**) wasn't in their scope of work.  I needed a change order signed before we could even get started.

My enthusiasm for this whole project was wearing very thin.

It took me a month to get all this put together via the necessary bureaucratic rigmarole.  Eventually, I managed to everything taken care of, and **$VacuumCorp** got started again.  We had a couple of meetings where we discussed configurations between all of us.  I had picked up on a few things by this point - after all, we were over a year into the process now.  But for the most part, I was lost during these meetings.  **$VacuumCorp** kept asking me about all manner of parameters, and I really didn't know what to tell them:

* ***What did I want for server and VM names?***  I don't care, why does that even matter?
* ***What sort of storage limits did I need for the VMs?***  I don't know, what does each one do?  Why do we need VMs to start with?
* ***Which servers need to be externally facing?***  You got me, I don't know.
* ***Did we need a domain controller?***  First, explain to me what a domain controller is, then I'll let you know.

In each of these things, I reached out to my IT Server Team for assistance.  But they wound up being about as useful as a condom machine in the Vatican.  Whenever I solicited their advice, the responses I'd get would be some variation of ""That's up to you"" or ""We'll follow your lead"" or something like that.  You know, generico bullsh!t answers in the same vein as ""*Try to win*"" and ""*Do better than you're currently doing*.""  That doesn't help me at all, guys!  I'm asking your opinion because I don't know what this is!  I want a *recommendation*, not for you to kick the can further down the road and make me try to figure it out on the fly.  Ugh.  Incredibly frustrating.

Eventually, I reached out to **$GiantCo** to help me on some of these points, and they wound up giving me a lot of assistance.  But for many of the questions that **$VacuumCorp** had of me, the folks at **$GiantCo** seemed quite reticent in helping me make a decision.  I think they understood that many of our configuration settings were specific to the **$Facility**, and they landed firmly in **$GlamRock**'s domain.  On the other hand, they didn't really seem to want to overstep the toes of **$VacuumCorp**, either.  Doing so could have been construed as infringement.  They may have just been pissed that we hadn't contracted with them to do all this work to start with, I really don't know.

What I could clearly see, however, was that we were having constant hangups in this process.  Nothing was moving smoothly.  We would have meetings where, essentially, nothing would get done.  **$VacuumCorp** would ask a design question, I wouldn't know the answer, I'd reach out to the Server Team for help, they wouldn't help me, I'd reach out to **$GiantCo** for help, they wouldn't help me, and I'd end the conversation by saying ""I'll have to look that up and get back to you.""  For several weeks, this continued in much the same way.

Over one weekend, I thought long and hard about all this.  Why weren't we progressing?  Where were the points of failure here?

And I had a *Come to Jesus* moment.

There had been numerous hangups throughout this process ever since the beginning.  Initially, it had been **$VacuumCorp**, as they hadn't been ready for over three months when we tried to get this stuff started.  Down the road, it had changed to our Legal department, since they wouldn't review the agreement we'd sent out.  Then it became IT, since **$VPofIT** held the agreement in limbo for about a month while he reviewed it.  Then it had become the Server Team, as they hadn't reviewed the agreement and I'd needed to get a change order to incorporate the Express Route.  Then it had been <telecom>, since it had taken their team months to send a single guy out to flip a switch.  But now all those hurdles had been cleared.  There was nothing standing directly in the way of our progress.  Why weren't we moving forward?  Where was the point of failure now?

I realized... it was **ME**.  ***I was the point of failure.***

My inexperience with GIS server architecture was keeping this project from moving forward.  I couldn't answer the questions that the dev teams had for me, and I was relying on other people instead.  My IT Server Team was deeply, profoundly incompetent with this and didn't have the expertise to help me, and **$GiantCo** didn't seem willing to assist me either.  And I was in the middle of it all.  In this orchestra of incompetence, *I was the conductor*.

I made up my mind, right then and there - I would *NOT* be the point of failure any longer.

I wanted this project to move forward.  I needed to take charge, learn these things, and address this in a knowledgeable, meaningful way.  And so I did.

I learned absolutely everything I could about GIS enterprise systems over the course of the next month.  I took all the classes I could in the Esri Academy on ArcGIS Enterprise, Server, and a ton of dependent products.  I had the reps from **$GiantCo** walk me through every step of the server design they had produced for me.  I did my own research into server environments, enterprise concepts, AWS/Azure, security protocols, and so on.  Most of what I read were IT articles.  But I read them, and I did my best to try to digest them.

And I think it worked.  After that month, I was able to answer a ton of questions I'd never even known about in the time leading up.  I actually knew what a domain controller was and what it did.  I still don't fully understand the underlying reasons for having VMs as part of these environments, but I could now determine what each one did and how they fit into the overall structure.  I could determine how much storage those VMs needed and why it was important to constrain size.  And if someone gave me a GIS server diagram, I felt reasonably confident that I could follow it from start to finish!  I still recognized that maintaining this eventual environment would be out of my league - I would probably need to hire a contractor to do so.  But I would at least have an inkling of what was going on - perhaps even a *""fairly good inkling""*, in fact!

Over the course of the next week, we had more meetings with **$VacuumCorp**.  And this time, I was able to answer most of their questions, even those that I'd had no clue about earlier!  Things got moving!  With this new direction, **$VacuumCorp** was able to spin up the cloud instance in Azure, the fundamental base that would one day house our ArcGIS Enterprise system.  I reviewed it with the reps from **$GiantCo**, and it looked very good!  Halleluia!  By God, I think we finally had something!

About a week later, I got my first bill from **$VacuumCorp** for this new environment.  I opened the letter (yes, they sent me a physical invoice instead of a digital one - whatevs).  When I saw the cost on the invoice, however, my eyes bulged out of my head.  Remember how I said in a previous story that we'd agreed on an overall support cost here of about $2,000 per month?

Yeah, this was over *4x that!*

I immediately tried to figure out what happened.  I reached out to my IT support folks, asking if the development cost had inadvertently been added to these support invoices.  However, they told me that this appeared to be the standard monthly maintenance cost.  I then sent a confused email to **$OverConfident**, asking if there had been some sort of start-up fee associated with the first month of this environment.  This was significantly higher than what we had agreed to pay.  He got back to me saying no, this was the cost for a month, and it was a prorated cost.  The insinuation was that this month was actually *cheaper* than future months would be!

*WTF, man!?!?*  I immediately scheduled a call with them to figure out what in the h3ll had happened.

As for their answer - well, I know it, but you all have to wait until tomorrow.  Thanks for reading!

hello again everyone this is my next story from the facility where we find out the points of failure in our approach to get a gis enterprise environment all of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records and i have started taking notes specifically so i can write stories for tfts theres also a lot that comes from rumors gossip and other people but most of this is very recent so any inaccuracies are entirely on me also i dont give permission for anyone else to use this tldr bluescreen has performed an illegal operation bluescreen must be closed you failed at failing for some context im not in it rather im a gis geographic information systems professional this particular world is quite small so i will do what i can to properly anonymize my tale however for reference all these stories take place at my new job working as the gis manager at the facility a major industrial entity in the american south heres my dramatis personae for this part me your friendly neighborhood gis guy tuckman drone pilot that works for the maintece department extremely awesome guy has taught me a lot distinguished vice president of engineering talented wellconnected opinionated and my direct boss he was honestly a very nice friendly person but i always found him a little intimidating glamrock primary server guy for the facility name taken from the fact that he was a legitimate rock star in the s now he works in it life amirite kathleen fearless leader of the it support team super sweet lady shes the best scotty one of the primary techs on the it support team really nice dude i mean all of the it team is nice but there are elements about gis that he still has to learn giantco nationwide engineering firm that had convinced the facility to start a gis program ultimately a good company with highly skilled people but had a different idea of how to approach this than i did vaccuumcorp csp that was hired to start our cloud standup they sucked their name is a testament to their awfulness lol overconfident main rep from vacuumcorp cocky arrogant overpromising and ultimately kind of shady whoops looks like you got a little hubris on your face let me wipe that off for you interlude aerial maneuvers me thats not going to scan the whole machine you need to increase the flight perimeter distance i was in the middle of a drone flight mission near the center of our primary campus along with tuckman the main drone admin at the time we were scanning one of the massive pieces of machinery that we operated there the drones rtk was having a lot of trouble getting a good satellite signal what with all the metal around us but wed finally found a spot where it could connect we were going to perform a perimeter scan where the drone would take photos at three different elevation tiers then we could stitch the images together to create a fully d model that i could import into gis if that sounds like fscking scifi magic thats because it is anyways tuckman was the pic pilot in command while i was the flight operator we were using an esri product to manage the flight and i had the flight planning app open on an ipad tuckman had set up the original perimeter distance however as i looked at the screen everything appeared to be shallow on the western side i walked over with the ipad to show him tuckman looking at the app and frowning no it looks fine to me me look here pointing to the western side of the flight plan see the distance you have here is about half what we have on the eastern side if we fly at this distance well wind up failing to capture the western side of the machine and our d model wont be accurate tuckman i think itll be fine we got enough clearance for everything me but we still dont have a lot of clearance remember our other scans when we sent our photos off for processing it missed a ton of data directly under the drone i really think we should back the perimeter up a little bit at least make it even on all sides tuckman uncertain yknow i aint sure me being an a and changing the flight mission settings here we go take a look here i backed everything up and it doesnt cross over any of the trackpaths for any of our other machinery out here we should be good with this i would think tuckman whatever you say if the drone gets damaged its coming out of your budget me fair enough tuckman then turned the drone on we connected everything the app took control of the device got it in the air and sent it on its way we really didnt have to do anything from here except watch the drone flew up to feet above the surface and begin flying in a perimeter around the machine everything seemed to be going well a few minutes later it lowered to feet as it did so i noticed something one of the other massive machines from further away was trolleying towards us i had made sure the flight path didnt overlap its trackway but now that i could see it better i could tell that there was a bunch of superstructure hanging off of it towards the top overhanging the track i got a sinking feeling in my stomach the drone lowered down to feet it started to fly the perimeter and it looked like it was dangerously close to intersecting this machine me hey uh tuckman how high is the housing up there tuckman staring at me deadpan feet me sht the device starting flying ever closer to the superstructure my heart started sinking further me um that thing is getting crazy close can we stop it tuckman looking down at the rc not from here the ipad has control and unless you cancel the mission it wont do anything me sht i looked at the ipad but it wasnt allowing me to interact with anything i think it was locked up actually it was very hot outside i turned to tuckman a bit of despair in my voice me it wont let me cancel the mission shaking head tuckman turned to look at the drone which was now making its final turn into the approach towards the machine tuckman sht it kept getting closer and closer and closer me and tuckman sht sht sht sht sht sht sht its path finally crossed the machine itself straight beneath the housing feet maybe inches away from the superstructure both sssssshhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiii and then it flew past tuckman let out an audible sigh of relief i stumbled backwards settling back on the bed of the truck wed driven out there after taking things in for a few more seconds watching the drone as it headed back to its home point tuckman turned to me with a halfsarcastic halfexasperated look on his face tuckman dmmit boy next time i take you flying you better bring an extra pair of britches with you i laughed as much from the nervous consolation that i wouldnt have to pay for a drone out of my gis budget as from anything else almost immediately afterwards the ipad overheated its fscking hot here yall and we had to cut out any other flights for the day i dont think either of us would have been up for it anyways but ive always made sure to bring an extra pair of brown pants in the truck for any flights ive done ever since just in case lol d back to the story when last we left off i had been trying to get my contractors and staff to construct our cloudbased gis enterprise environment for me it had been fraught with issues we had spent about a year building things so far and each month resulted in multiple steps forward and multiple steps back most recently we had attempted a kickoff meeting only to discover that a major component that had been told repeatedly to the subcontractor vacuumcorp wasnt in their scope of work i needed a change order signed before we could even get started my enthusiasm for this whole project was wearing very thin it took me a month to get all this put together via the necessary bureaucratic rigmarole eventually i managed to everything taken care of and vacuumcorp got started again we had a couple of meetings where we discussed configurations between all of us i had picked up on a few things by this point after all we were over a year into the process now but for the most part i was lost during these meetings vacuumcorp kept asking me about all manner of parameters and i really didnt know what to tell them what did i want for server and vm names i dont care why does that even matter what sort of storage limits did i need for the vms i dont know what does each one do why do we need vms to start with which servers need to be externally facing you got me i dont know did we need a domain controller first explain to me what a domain controller is then ill let you know in each of these things i reached out to my it server team for assistance but they wound up being about as useful as a condom machine in the vatican whenever i solicited their advice the responses id get would be some variation of thats up to you or well follow your lead or something like that you know generico bullsht answers in the same vein as try to win and do better than youre currently doing that doesnt help me at all guys im asking your opinion because i dont know what this is i want a recommendation not for you to kick the can further down the road and make me try to figure it out on the fly ugh incredibly frustrating eventually i reached out to giantco to help me on some of these points and they wound up giving me a lot of assistance but for many of the questions that vacuumcorp had of me the folks at giantco seemed quite reticent in helping me make a decision i think they understood that many of our configuration settings were specific to the facility and they landed firmly in glamrocks domain on the other hand they didnt really seem to want to overstep the toes of vacuumcorp either doing so could have been construed as infringement they may have just been pissed that we hadnt contracted with them to do all this work to start with i really dont know what i could clearly see however was that we were having constant hangups in this process nothing was moving smoothly we would have meetings where essentially nothing would get done vacuumcorp would ask a design question i wouldnt know the answer id reach out to the server team for help they wouldnt help me id reach out to giantco for help they wouldnt help me and id end the conversation by saying ill have to look that up and get back to you for several weeks this continued in much the same way over one weekend i thought long and hard about all this why werent we progressing where were the points of failure here and i had a come to jesus moment there had been numerous hangups throughout this process ever since the beginning initially it had been vacuumcorp as they hadnt been ready for over three months when we tried to get this stuff started down the road it had changed to our legal department since they wouldnt review the agreement wed sent out then it became it since vpofit held the agreement in limbo for about a month while he reviewed it then it had become the server team as they hadnt reviewed the agreement and id needed to get a change order to incorporate the express route then it had been telecom since it had taken their team months to send a single guy out to flip a switch but now all those hurdles had been cleared there was nothing standing directly in the way of our progress why werent we moving forward where was the point of failure now i realized it was me i was the point of failure my inexperience with gis server architecture was keeping this project from moving forward i couldnt answer the questions that the dev teams had for me and i was relying on other people instead my it server team was deeply profoundly incompetent with this and didnt have the expertise to help me and giantco didnt seem willing to assist me either and i was in the middle of it all in this orchestra of incompetence i was the conductor i made up my mind right then and there i would not be the point of failure any longer i wanted this project to move forward i needed to take charge learn these things and address this in a knowledgeable meaningful way and so i did i learned absolutely everything i could about gis enterprise systems over the course of the next month i took all the classes i could in the esri academy on arcgis enterprise server and a ton of dependent products i had the reps from giantco walk me through every step of the server design they had produced for me i did my own research into server environments enterprise concepts awsazure security protocols and so on most of what i read were it articles but i read them and i did my best to try to digest them and i think it worked after that month i was able to answer a ton of questions id never even known about in the time leading up i actually knew what a domain controller was and what it did i still dont fully understand the underlying reasons for having vms as part of these environments but i could now determine what each one did and how they fit into the overall structure i could determine how much

1lrxauq,Tech,talesfromtechsupport,"Tales from the $Facility: Part 4 - The Enterprise Environment Happy 4th, y'all!  This is my next story from the **$Facility**, where we take the first steps towards deploying our GIS enterprise environment.  All of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records (and I have started taking notes specifically so I can write stories for TFTS!)  There's also a lot that comes from rumors, gossip, and other people, but most of this is very recent, so any inaccuracies are entirely on me.  Also, I don't give permission for anyone else to use this.

TL/DR: When all else fails, look to the restorative power of a hammer and kinetic maintenance.

For some context, I'm not in IT; rather, I'm a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) professional.  This particular world is quite small, so I will do what I can to properly anonymize my tale.  However, for reference, all these stories take place at my new job working as the GIS Manager at the $Facility, a major industrial entity in the American South.  Here's my Dramatis Personae for this part:

* **$Me**: Your friendly neighborhood GIS guy.
* **$Distinguished**: Vice President of Engineering.  Talented, well-connected, opinionated, and my direct boss.  He was honestly a very nice, friendly person, but I always found him a little intimidating.
* **$GlamRock**: Primary server guy for the $Facility.  Name taken from the fact that he was a legitimate rock star in the 1980s.  Now he works in IT.  Life, amirite?
* **$VPofIT**: Vice President of IT.  Extremely concerned about security and likes to get into the weeds, but ultimately not a mean-spirited manager.
* **$GiantCo**: Nationwide engineering firm that had convinced the $Facility to start a GIS program.  Ultimately a good company with highly skilled people, but had a different idea of how to approach this than I did.
* **$VaccuumCorp**: CSP that was hired to start our cloud standup.  They sucked.  Their name is a testament to their awfulness.  Lol.
* **$OverConfident**: Main rep from $VacuumCorp.  Cocky, arrogant, overpromising, and ultimately kind of shady.  Whoops, looks like you got a little hubris on your face, let me wipe that off for you.

When we last left off, all the various interests that were involved in creating our GIS Enterprise Environment had finally gotten their sh!t together and were ready to begin building this thing.  They contacted me to let me know that everything was underway and wanted me to be involved with the process.  As I mentioned before, I already had a functional file server system in place.  However, everyone else seemed to think that we didn't really have GIS implemented here until this environment was ready to go.  So I was willing to play by everyone else's rules as we moved forward to deployment.

There was a lot going on here, though.  Much of what had been decided was made by other parties, in many cases before I had even arrived at the **$Facility**.  The two major players in this saga were our IT Server Team, and our primary integrator, **$GiantCo**.

The IT Server Team was headed by **$GlamRock.  T**hey were responsible for making sure that this new GIS enterprise environment would work with the **$Facility**'s existing architecture.  Their main concerns had been to ensure that everything was secure, that it could be scalable for what would be needed in the future, and could be maintained with a minimum of additional effort.  They made several decisions that I agreed with... as well as a few that I did not.

One of the things I *did* agree with was their concern for security.  I've always worked in GIS positions where data disclosure is an extremely bad thing, so I appreciated the server team's focus on this.  **$GlamRock** told me that there was a particular set of security protocols for cloud-based platforms that he wanted to have implemented that I'll call ***$SecurityPolicy***.  This made complete sense to me; I was entirely on-board.

However, some other things they touted made much less sense.  One was their insistence that we have an extremely-robust internet connection between our data center and this cloud environment (an ""Express Route"").  I didn't understand why this was necessary.  After all, most of this would live entirely in the cloud, never touching our network at all.  Yet the server guys consistently told me that we had to have this.  Honestly, I think I may have spooked them when I originally got to talking about GIS.  I told them how much data storage a functional GIS environment of our complexity would need, and they'd never dealt with storage requirements that extensive before.  **$GlamRock** must have freaked out and figured I'd be transferring that much data to the cloud on a constant basis.  Completely not the case, but I wanted to make sure that I played nice with the IT folks.  So I acquiesced, trusting that the server guys knew what they were talking about. \*ominous music\*

The other main player in this saga was **$GiantCo**.  They had been the ones that had originally pitched GIS to the **$Facility** in the first place.  They'd created an extremely nice webmap for one of our new campuses which had sold GIS to pretty much all parties.  Now that things were getting off the ground, they had been contracted as the primary designer/integrator of this new GIS environment.  They had a lot at stake in all this, and were doing their best to see GIS take off.  Let me just say that the staff at **$GiantCo** was, by and large, very good.  And the company has a HUGE amount of GIS experience.  Lots of win.

But in our case, I don't think what they originally envisioned would have worked well here.  Essentially, they wanted us to create a professional IT-style development/production environment on an enterprise server, then roll out large numbers of ArcGIS Pro licenses to users across the organization.  The new GIS Manager would help to run things, and **$GiantCo** would remain on-hand to help out with logistics, data services, and so on.  Not a bad approach - for a more technologically-mature organization.  However, that's not how the **$Facility** really could have absorbed all this.  That whole concept of giving ArcGIS Pro to our staff?  Y'all, Pro is not something you just ""*learn*"" in a few days.  It is an incredibly complex program that I'm still learning, even after 4 years of getting started with it.  It's like trying to roll out Photoshop or SQL Server to all your employees and just expecting them to know how to use them.  I was confident that this wouldn't result in widespread adoption - and I was right.  I got Pro installed on each of the engineers' computers and ran multiple training courses, and not one of them has opened the program since I installed it over two years ago.  Swing and a miss, **$GiantCo**.  And as for the professional development/production environment?  Something like that really takes more staff, oversight, and funding than the **$Facility** was willing to invest into all this.  Perhaps that had been **$GiantCo**'s purpose in the first place - after seeing how much would be needed here, the **$Facility** would have to contract with **$GiantCo** for the necessary services.  Regardless, I could see a lot of nested issues in this approach.

Yet despite my reservations, I still wanted to give all this a shot.  I knew that ArcGIS Enterprise allowed significantly more nuanced control over a GIS architecture.  And I also was aware that many of the best solutions - Indoors, Utilities Network, ImageServer, so on - require Enterprise to work.  So I wanted to see it successful in some fashion.  I would also be able to learn more about it myself in the process.

And that was the final weak link in all this - ***$Me***.  I did not have the experience I needed to fully helm the development of this type of environment.  I knew plenty about GIS in general, even about building an system architecture, but very little about *this type* of architecture.  I had to trust that all the other parties involved knew what they were doing.  And unfortunately for me, I wasn't really able to fully hold them to account since I didn't really know what to look for.  Not too good, I must admit.

But I was determined to try.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?  When I had told **$GlamRock** that I wanted us to build out an ArcGIS Enterprise Environment, I meant it.

*So it began*.

Not long after my first conversations with the server team, **$GlamRock** called me and said they were reaching out to a third-party contractor to create the cloud servers in Azure.  The contractor chosen was **$VacuumCorp**.  Once again, this was something I didn't understand.  I asked why we were doing this when we already had **$GiantCo** on retainer?  The server team's response was that **$VacuumCorp** had all of the necessary Microsoft credentials and could take care of this without much difficulty.  Y'all... *why?!?*  **$GiantCo** was our primary integrator and, true to their name, was *GIANT*.  They had all the same techs and certifications too!  I literally have no idea why this other company was chosen.  Something crazy-fscked behind the scenes, or a quandary that will show up on the reboot of Unsolved Mysteries one day.

I didn't fight things here, as I didn't want to upset the server team and lose all the hard-earned goodwill I'd gained with IT.  Despite this, I was still very anxious as we eased into this process.

Anyways, I was told to sit tight while **$VacuumCorp** was getting mobilized.  So I did.  For *three months*, I ""sat tight.""  It took **$VacuumCorp** until the end of the calendar year to finally get back to my IT Department to say that they were ready to begin.  Jesus.  Anyways, I sat in on the first pre-contract conversation along with the server team.  Most of what was said went right over my head.  Some things I did get, however.  **$GlamRock** asked for assurances that the Azure instance would be compliant with ***$SecurityProtocol***, to which their primary rep, **$OverConfident**, guaranteed it would be.  I was glad to hear this.  However, I was also very nervous that I didn't understand so much of what they were saying, and I would be responsible for managing this one day.  At the end of the meeting, I popped up with a single question, the only one that was pertinent in my mind.

>**$Me**: So have you all ever done an Esri integration before?

>**$OverConfident**: Well, no, we haven't.  But we're confident we can do this, and we're looking forward to the opportunity to learn!

So let me just recap here, for those of you watching at home:

* **$VacuumCorp** had never done an Esri integration before.
* The **$Facility**'s IT Server Team had never set up a cloud-based environment before, nor had ever migrated anything to one.
* I had very little experience with ArcGIS Enterprise, and I was technically supposed to be managing this thing.

Planning for success, aren't we?  Let's get this clusterfsck moving.

The first actionable was to get the Scope of Work (SOW) nailed down.  This took about two months to figure out.  First off, we had tons of bureaucracy to wade through, on both our sides.  While we bush-hogged our way through that, **$OverConfident** asked me for a server diagram.  When I saw that email, my eyes popped out of my face and splattered on the desk.  I'd never put together a server diagram before in my life - I didn't even know what one was!  I needed help.  I reached out to a friend and colleague of mine, **$Kate**.  If you'll recall, she was the one that originally recommended me to the **$Facility**.  I asked her if she had a sample diagram I could use, and she sent me hers.  I adjusted it with some help from **$GiantCo**, then sent it off.  It was horribly basic.  However, I hoped it would answer the fundamental questions about what we would need.

**$VacuumCorp** got back to me with a ton of questions.  I wound up working over the course of a month or so to build something that looked good by their eyes.  Most of what was sent off was developed by **$GiantCo** (who should have been doing all this in the first place, tbh).  Anyways, we got that submitted to **$VacuumCorp**.  Not too long afterwards, I saw an email come in with the SOW for the project (or so I thought, ominous music), signed by one of the folks on my server team.

I presumed that we were moving forward now.  Unfortunately, this whole process was fraught with problems, halting starts, one step forward and two steps back.  After another month of development, **$OverConfident** sent me an agreement on how much the support costs would be once everything was up and running.  By my very inexperienced eyes, it appeared to be comprehensive, somewhere in the range of about $2,000 per month.  I took this to **$Distinguished**, and he said it looked ok, but he needed me to run the agreement through our legal team and **$VPofIT**.  So I did.

And it took *forever*.  Jesus.  I sent the agreement off to legal, and for two months, they completely ghosted me.  I did my best to follow up with them, but I never got anywhere.  Eventually, I asked **$Distinguished** if he could help.  He proceeded to throw our legal team *directly* under the bus during one of the C-suite meetings, basically insinuating that if they couldn't get the work done, we'd find someone else.  By the end of that week, I had my legal review.

After leaping the legal hurdles, I then sent this to **$VPofIT**.  He told me that he'd review everything by the end of the week I'd sent it.  I waited for the review that Friday... and nothing.  I gently reminded him week after week after that, and he'd respond with ""Oops, something came up"" or ""Totally skipped my mind, I'll have it to you by tomorrow.""  I felt very trapped in dealing with him.  I didn't want to go down the same avenue as I had with our legal team - I wanted to maintain a good relationship with IT.  So I approached this whole matter delicately.  But even then, it was immensely frustrating.  Eventually, **$VPofIT** finally got me his review.  He had a bunch of asinine questions or non-entities that he wanted me to address, fully displaying how little experience the IT team had in using cloud-based solutions.  But I answered everything, and a week later, he gave me his blessing on the environment.

*Thank God*.  I had gotten the agreement from **$VacuumCorp** in April.  It was August now.  I sent the finalized, agreed-upon contract to **$Distinguished** and let him know that all parties were ok with this, and he sent me his signed copy less than an hour later.  Finally!

We set up a kickoff meeting for the first week in September.  At that meeting, **$VacuumCorp** had their entire team assembled.  On my side, we had the entire IT Server Team, headed by **$GlamRock**.  We had the reps from **$GiantCo** as well.  It was pretty all-encompassing.  I was, for the time being, cautiously optimistic.

The first few minutes of the meeting were introductions.  **$OverConfident** wasted no time touting the abilities of his team.  Look, I understand that you want to showcase how much capability you're bringing to the project, but after the third time you say your CSP tech is ""*literally the best in the world*,"" I'm starting to think you're dealing with some insecurities.  Anyways, this self-congratulatory circle-jerk went on for about five minutes, then we delved into the meat of the kickoff.  Within a minute of us starting, **$GlamRock** stopped everything and piped up:

>**$GlamRock**: Wait, I don't see in the project approach where you'll be setting this to run with our Express Route.  And the Express Route isn't even configured right now, as it is.

>**$OverConfident**: What do you mean?  You wanted this configured with an Express Route?

>**$GlamRock** (incredulous): *YES!*  We've been telling you that since the beginning!  Is this not incorporated into the SOW?

>**$OverConfident**: ...No?  If you all want this, we'll need to issue a change order to cover it.  This wasn't in the original agreement.

>**$GlamRock**: Then let's do that.  And the setup will have to wait until <telecom> is able to come out and configure the Express Route, too.

>**$OverConfident**: I guess that's it for this meeting.

Total elapsed time between the start of our discussion and the moment where we hit a snag?  *Less than two minutes.*

I rubbed my temples as I got up and went back to my desk.  I'd have to delve back through all that h3ll once more, this time to set up a Change Order.  And I would have to tell my bosses that the project was going to cost more money now.  I was not looking forward to *any* of that.  At the same time, I came to the disturbing realization that my IT Server Team had not actually *looked* at the SOW itself - otherwise they would have known about this before we'd even started!  What other things had fallen through the cracks here?  *What was going to fall through in the future?*  I was extremely uncertain about what would occur - and my server team's level of accountability and oversight - as I moved forward.

While I worked on this, **$GlamRock** told me they had started hounding <telecom> to get out and configure our Express Route.  They had first contacted the company shortly after I'd started working here, and only recently had sent a tech.  He basically went into our data center, flipped a switch, and left.  We waited almost a year for that?!?  *Jebus.*  Yet I'll admit that I got this info from **$GlamRock**, not the <telecom> - it's entirely likely that the server team hadn't made the request until *waaaay* after they actually told me they did.  I suppose I'll never know.

Towards the end of the summer, I was getting pretty disillusioned with all of this.  Would we ever finish?  Would we ever have something that would work?

I guess you'll find out tomorrow :)

[Mr\_Cartographer's Atlas, Volume I](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/16u1gxn/mr_cartographers_atlas_volume_i/)",['azure'],tales from the facility part the enterprise environment happy th yall this is my next story from the facility where we take the first steps towards deploying our gis enterprise environment all of this is from the best of my memory along with some personal records and i have started taking notes specifically so i can write stories for tfts theres also a lot that comes from rumors gossip and other people but most of this is very recent so any inaccuracies are entirely on me also i dont give permission for anyone else to use this tldr when all else fails look to the restorative power of a hammer and kinetic maintece for some context im not in it rather im a gis geographic information systems professional this particular world is quite small so i will do what i can to properly anonymize my tale however for reference all these stories take place at my new job working as the gis manager at the facility a major industrial entity in the american south heres my dramatis personae for this part me your friendly neighborhood gis guy distinguished vice president of engineering talented wellconnected opinionated and my direct boss he was honestly a very nice friendly person but i always found him a little intimidating glamrock primary server guy for the facility name taken from the fact that he was a legitimate rock star in the s now he works in it life amirite vpofit vice president of it extremely concerned about security and likes to get into the weeds but ultimately not a meanspirited manager giantco nationwide engineering firm that had convinced the facility to start a gis program ultimately a good company with highly skilled people but had a different idea of how to approach this than i did vaccuumcorp csp that was hired to start our cloud standup they sucked their name is a testament to their awfulness lol overconfident main rep from vacuumcorp cocky arrogant overpromising and ultimately kind of shady whoops looks like you got a little hubris on your face let me wipe that off for you when we last left off all the various interests that were involved in creating our gis enterprise environment had finally gotten their sht together and were ready to begin building this thing they contacted me to let me know that everything was underway and wanted me to be involved with the process as i mentioned before i already had a functional file server system in place however everyone else seemed to think that we didnt really have gis implemented here until this environment was ready to go so i was willing to play by everyone elses rules as we moved forward to deployment there was a lot going on here though much of what had been decided was made by other parties in many cases before i had even arrived at the facility the two major players in this saga were our it server team and our primary integrator giantco the it server team was headed by glamrock they were responsible for making sure that this new gis enterprise environment would work with the facilitys existing architecture their main concerns had been to ensure that everything was secure that it could be scalable for what would be needed in the future and could be maintained with a minimum of additional effort they made several decisions that i agreed with as well as a few that i did not one of the things i did agree with was their concern for security ive always worked in gis positions where data disclosure is an extremely bad thing so i appreciated the server teams focus on this glamrock told me that there was a particular set of security protocols for cloudbased platforms that he wanted to have implemented that ill call securitypolicy this made complete sense to me i was entirely onboard however some other things they touted made much less sense one was their insistence that we have an extremelyrobust internet connection between our data center and this cloud environment an express route i didnt understand why this was necessary after all most of this would live entirely in the cloud never touching our network at all yet the server guys consistently told me that we had to have this honestly i think i may have spooked them when i originally got to talking about gis i told them how much data storage a functional gis environment of our complexity would need and theyd never dealt with storage requirements that extensive before glamrock must have freaked out and figured id be transferring that much data to the cloud on a constant basis completely not the case but i wanted to make sure that i played nice with the it folks so i acquiesced trusting that the server guys knew what they were talking about ominous music the other main player in this saga was giantco they had been the ones that had originally pitched gis to the facility in the first place theyd created an extremely nice webmap for one of our new campuses which had sold gis to pretty much all parties now that things were getting off the ground they had been contracted as the primary designerintegrator of this new gis environment they had a lot at stake in all this and were doing their best to see gis take off let me just say that the staff at giantco was by and large very good and the company has a huge amount of gis experience lots of win but in our case i dont think what they originally envisioned would have worked well here essentially they wanted us to create a professional itstyle developmentproduction environment on an enterprise server then roll out large numbers of arcgis pro licenses to users across the organization the new gis manager would help to run things and giantco would remain onhand to help out with logistics data services and so on not a bad approach for a more technologicallymature organization however thats not how the facility really could have absorbed all this that whole concept of giving arcgis pro to our staff yall pro is not something you just learn in a few days it is an incredibly complex program that im still learning even after years of getting started with it its like trying to roll out photoshop or sql server to all your employees and just expecting them to know how to use them i was confident that this wouldnt result in widespread adoption and i was right i got pro installed on each of the engineers computers and ran multiple training courses and not one of them has opened the program since i installed it over two years ago swing and a miss giantco and as for the professional developmentproduction environment something like that really takes more staff oversight and funding than the facility was willing to invest into all this perhaps that had been giantcos purpose in the first place after seeing how much would be needed here the facility would have to contract with giantco for the necessary services regardless i could see a lot of nested issues in this approach yet despite my reservations i still wanted to give all this a shot i knew that arcgis enterprise allowed significantly more nuanced control over a gis architecture and i also was aware that many of the best solutions indoors utilities network imageserver so on require enterprise to work so i wanted to see it successful in some fashion i would also be able to learn more about it myself in the process and that was the final weak link in all this me i did not have the experience i needed to fully helm the development of this type of environment i knew plenty about gis in general even about building an system architecture but very little about this type of architecture i had to trust that all the other parties involved knew what they were doing and unfortunately for me i wasnt really able to fully hold them to account since i didnt really know what to look for not too good i must admit but i was determined to try nothing ventured nothing gained right when i had told glamrock that i wanted us to build out an arcgis enterprise environment i meant it so it began not long after my first conversations with the server team glamrock called me and said they were reaching out to a thirdparty contractor to create the cloud servers in azure the contractor chosen was vacuumcorp once again this was something i didnt understand i asked why we were doing this when we already had giantco on retainer the server teams response was that vacuumcorp had all of the necessary microsoft credentials and could take care of this without much difficulty yall why giantco was our primary integrator and true to their name was giant they had all the same techs and certifications too i literally have no idea why this other company was chosen something crazyfscked behind the scenes or a quandary that will show up on the reboot of unsolved mysteries one day i didnt fight things here as i didnt want to upset the server team and lose all the hardearned goodwill id gained with it despite this i was still very anxious as we eased into this process anyways i was told to sit tight while vacuumcorp was getting mobilized so i did for three months i sat tight it took vacuumcorp until the end of the calendar year to finally get back to my it department to say that they were ready to begin jesus anyways i sat in on the first precontract conversation along with the server team most of what was said went right over my head some things i did get however glamrock asked for assurances that the azure instance would be compliant with securityprotocol to which their primary rep overconfident guaranteed it would be i was glad to hear this however i was also very nervous that i didnt understand so much of what they were saying and i would be responsible for managing this one day at the end of the meeting i popped up with a single question the only one that was pertinent in my mind me so have you all ever done an esri integration before overconfident well no we havent but were confident we can do this and were looking forward to the opportunity to learn so let me just recap here for those of you watching at home vacuumcorp had never done an esri integration before the facilitys it server team had never set up a cloudbased environment before nor had ever migrated anything to one i had very little experience with arcgis enterprise and i was technically supposed to be managing this thing planning for success arent we lets get this clusterfsck moving the first actionable was to get the scope of work sow nailed down this took about two months to figure out first off we had tons of bureaucracy to wade through on both our sides while we bushhogged our way through that overconfident asked me for a server diagram when i saw that email my eyes popped out of my face and splattered on the desk id never put together a server diagram before in my life i didnt even know what one was i needed help i reached out to a friend and colleague of mine kate if youll recall she was the one that originally recommended me to the facility i asked her if she had a sample diagram i could use and she sent me hers i adjusted it with some help from giantco then sent it off it was horribly basic however i hoped it would answer the fundamental questions about what we would need vacuumcorp got back to me with a ton of questions i wound up working over the course of a month or so to build something that looked good by their eyes most of what was sent off was developed by giantco who should have been doing all this in the first place tbh anyways we got that submitted to vacuumcorp not too long afterwards i saw an email come in with the sow for the project or so i thought ominous music signed by one of the folks on my server team i presumed that we were moving forward now unfortunately this whole process was fraught with problems halting starts one step forward and two steps back after another month of development overconfident sent me an agreement on how much the support costs would be once everything was up and running by my very inexperienced eyes it appeared to be comprehensive somewhere in the range of about per month i took this to distinguished and he said it looked ok but he needed me to run the agreement through our legal team and vpofit so i did and it took forever jesus i sent the agreement off to legal and for two months they completely ghosted me i did my best to follow up with them but i never got anywhere eventually i asked distinguished if he could help he proceeded to throw our legal team directly under the bus during one of the csuite meetings basically insinuating that if they couldnt get the work done wed find someone else by the end of that week i had my legal review after leaping the legal hurdles i then sent this to vpofit he told me that hed review everything by the end of the week id sent it i waited for the review that friday and nothing i gently reminded him week after week after that and hed respond with oops something came up or totally skipped my mind ill have it to you by tomorrow i felt very trapped in dealing with him i didnt want to go down the same avenue as i had with our legal team i wanted to maintain a good relationship with it so i approached this whole matter delicately but even then it was immensely frustrating eventually vpofit finally got me his review he had a bunch of asinine questions or nonentities that he wanted me to address fully displaying how little experience the it team had in using cloudbased solutions but i answered everything and a week later he gave me his blessing on the environment thank god i had gotten the agreement from vacuumcorp in april it was august now i sent the finalized agreedupon contract to distinguished and let him know that all parties were ok with this and he sent me his signed copy less than an hour later finally we set up a kickoff meeting for the first week in september at that meeting vacuumcorp had their

1l9yvn9,Tech,talesfromtechsupport,"“Phone isn’t providing a sign in code! It just has this button on the screen that says ‘refresh code’!” It from state government here. Got an incident today for a teams phone problem from my *favorite* state department. And I say that with so much sarcasm. 

This department is notorious for ignoring instructions and then freaking out when things don’t work as a result. For the teams phones, for example, they have been told many times they need to put in a *network request* (so the networks are configured for the teams phones) and a *telephone request* (so they can get a Teams phone number) before they set up a physical phone. If you don’t do these two things first, your phone isn’t going to work properly. They always “forget” and then make it a problem for everyone.

Well, this one ticket I got added to, the issue was that the guy had his new teams phone all set up, plugged in and everything, but he couldn’t sign it. It told him to go to the Microsoft sign in page and type in the code provided, but according to him no code was provided. 

Generally on his phone model, “not providing a sign in code” is an instant red flag that the network isn’t configured. So my very first thing asking him? *Have you put in a network request ticket for this phone?* And explained to him why it’s possible the networks not configured. 

Shockingly, he provided both the ticket number for his network request, the name of the technician who worked on it, and the date the request was completed. I’m genuinely not used to that from his department. A pleasant surprise. So likely not a network issue, but I shot a message to the technician to see if he could check on the network just in case. Always possible a firewall got missed, after all. 

Entering the territory of “this might actually be a genuine issue” I started grilling him for more details on what exactly was going on. Asking how the phone was plugged in, if the network cable was damaged at all, asking him to describe what happens when he presses the Refresh Code button on the screen (ie does it loop back to the sign in page unable to connect, does it give him any error messages, Etc etc)

Him: “oh, I guess I didn’t know I had to clicked it.”

He didn’t know that he had to click the button that said to refresh to get the code he needed. The big button on the middle of the screen that says *refresh code* with the log in instructions right there above it. 

This whole circus because he wasn’t clicking the button that the phone was telling him to click. Had such high hopes that it wasn’t going to be user error this time. 

Edit: for people who need the extra detail: these phones *do* automatically provide codes, so long as they are connected to a network, when powered on. But they expire after a few minutes and get replaced by a refresh code button after expiration.  And right above it is the url to sign in to Microsoft via computer and text saying telling users to use the code provided below by the phone. It is very, very straightforward. If it is not connected to the network, it will say refresh code from the start, and either be greyed out or put ppl through the aforementioned loop (hence why I had asked him that). If the code has expired, the box will change to say refresh code.

1l94s0b,Tech,talesfromtechsupport,"Don't want PC/domain passwords after upgrades? OK...watch what happens! About 10 years ago I, working for an MSP, get assigned a project to modernize a small family manufacturing company of about 15 people (about 8 in the office plus roughly the same number of shop employees). They're getting new PCs, Windows 10, Office 365, better Internet service, server upgrades, network & Wi-Fi, and so on. Easy enough given the size, and a pretty enjoyable project all in all.

Of course, here's where it deviated from the norm. I go on-site to meet with the business owner, the lead brother in this family-led company, to get the project scope defined and establish time frames. Among other project-related things, he also said, ""Oh, and I want everyone to not have to have a password."" They had a small Windows domain with Active Directory.

I said, my dude, not only can't I in good faith *not* have you have ""a password"" for your accounts, but our policy as a company wouldn't permit me to do that anyway. It wouldn't be a good look. After some back and forth, the owner agreed to let us assign correct, appropriate passwords to their accounts as part of the project. OK then, problem solved. The project goes really well, we install new hardware, PCs, and all equipment as intended. The owner was actually quite pleased with how things went - and gave we on-siter's a gift card for a free lunch. Once wrapped up I turned over day to day management of this customer to our helpdesk staff and moved on as per usual.

About a year or so later I see a ticket come across our system. Apparently, shortly after the project was done, the owner spent some time Googling how to adjust their password complexity & requirements - and did so. Then he reset everyone's password to something simple like ""password"" or ""12345"" (including the domain admin account) and went about his merry way. But unbeknownst to him, his nephew - a complete nepo hire - had downloaded a different ""PDF Viewer"" on his PC, but when it did nothing he didn't think anything of it. Instead of being the new Adobe, Johnny's ""PDF Viewer"" was actually ransomware, running in the background, trying to brute-force spread to the rest of the network. They came in one morning with the dreaded ""your PC has been locked"" in big red screens across all their office PCs.

1kyj6zm,Tech,talesfromtechsupport,"Blank Monitor = IT Blocked the Switch tldr; half of my job would go away if people read the messages they got on their screens

Over the past few months we’ve been slowly building up one of our field offices as they’ve been hiring people which means sending out the occasional new workstation/monitors, etc. for new users to login to. They get the PC, plug it into the switch on-site, and go. Pretty standard and no issues up until this one. One day a ticket comes into the helpdesk from the office admin out there that says “Can we please unblock port X on the switch so the new guy can access the internet?”

Immediately I raise an eyebrow because we don’t “block the internet” on any of our switch ports at any other sites and it wouldn’t make any sense for just this ONE port not to work when we’ve been sending them new machines for weeks now. So I grab the ticket and do a bit of investigative work by opening up our remote access software where I can see the PC clearly showing as online as well as logging into the firewall and seeing the PC connected to the switch port in question. I responded back to the ticket saying things looked okay from my end but figured I might be looking at the wrong PC and asked her to confirm the name of the machine (we stick a label with the PC name on every PC we send out). Crickets.

Five minutes later, the foreman for the site calls my coworker annoyed saying “you guys need to fix this, this guy is just sitting here unable to do any work” and moments after that the user himself sends in a ticket with the same description as above: “please unblock port X on the switch”. So now I’m getting annoyed and after finally tracking down their phone number (that everyone neglected to give us) I give the guy a call.

I confirmed the PC name with him, remoted into the machine and then saw the Windows login screen. I thought “oh, he must just not be entering his password correctly, I guess I could see why they thought it was the internet”, so I asked him to try entering his password again to see what would happen. He says he doesn’t see anything, just a blank monitor that has the word English on it.

And then it clicked. We have been sending them newer Dell monitors that, when you first plug them in, you just have to use one of the physical buttons on the monitor to, you know, select your language. As instructed on the screen itself. He reads the message, presses the button it tells him to, and WHOA, everything works! Go figure. 

Now like a lot of you I’m sure that when someone describes an issue like “the internet doesn’t work”, you run down the mental checklist of other stuff that might actually be going on that they lack the tech literacy to describe but this was a whole other level that I wasn’t prepared for.

I’m currently working in Germany (I am german, mid-30s) in academic basic biomedical science, with a PhD. Formally a molecular biologist with 10 years of self-taught and daily hands-on experience in bioinformatics / data science (R, Bash, Linux, containers, Git, HPC environments), but I want to transition into DevOps. I always enjoyed that technical aspects of my computational work much more than the actual science I did, that's why I want to switch now permanently.

Do you think someone with such a science background could have a good job prospects in DevOps once I build the necessary skills? I am not worried at all to learn the required skillset, training myself in computational things with no formal education in that field is what I do ever since, after all.

I’m 21 and working as a IT FIELD TECHNICAN through Dell/Unisys. I’ve been in the role for about 10 months now and I’m honestly planning to leave next month.

The travel is killing me. I spend around 2 hours just to go pick up parts, then more time driving to different customer sites, and then another 1.5hours back home. I’m just sick and tired driving in London , there’s so much traffic and roads are all 20mph! My car is starting to fall apart from all the driving (overheating, coolant issues, battery problems)-  I don’t trust it in long journey and it’s stressing me out (I’ve spent a lot of money replacing car parts but looks like I got a cracked cylinder or head gasket issue ). On top of that, I don’t feel like I’m learning anything new and the pay is awful once petrol is taken out. 

The positive side is that I’ve already had a few interviews for IT roles and I’m studying for Network+. After that I plan to go for Security+.

In terms of experience I’ve been:
• Repairing laptops, desktops and workstations (motherboards, LCDs, RAM, SSDs etc)
• Deploying and configuring Windows OS, imaging, BIOS and drivers
• Troubleshooting OS and hardware issues
• Using networking fundamentals (IP, DNS, DHCP) to test and restore connectivity

The lead (the only one with a real SysAdmin title) often said in both jest and seriousness that we were really Tier 3's because of the kinds of tickets we were expected to complete: a lot of server admin (linux/windows), networking tickets, I did some custom powershell scripting / wrote some code for our NOC screens, on top of the seemingly endless Tier 1 type tickets. The work wasn't that impressive to me, being someone who did these kinds of things as a hobby.

I left that MSP (the pay was miserable) and I took a job in an unrelated industry (engineering tech work in aviation). On a whim, I applied to a SysAdmin job with a well-known government contractor. I'm shocked that I received an invitation to interview and, being away from pretty much all things tech/IT for three years now, ad well as not having any certifications, I feel woefully unprepared.

A few questions:

1. Is it worth cramming for the next four days before the interview? Ideal SysAdmin experience is so wide that I know for a fact I won't be able to cover all bases, or even the specific knowledge area requirements for the position.
2. Is it still possible to be successful in this role on the off chance I am given a formal offer?

I thought the AWS SAA was considered mid level though.

Help desk jobs at local msps here are all pretty similar, they're small businesses and the jobs could go at any time especially in this crappy market.

 I interviewed at a company that was even worse than the one that just laid me off. The thing that really annoyed me about that interview was that I was going back and forth between an Indian recruiter who was kind of annoying and then when I finally got the interview the human resources person told me that they're not even hiring at the moment but our screening applicants for when positions open up. Even then it was indefinite suggesting that the position would only open up if they onboard a new client.

I just think you might build more hard skills to get you out of help desk with stuff like the CloudOps/SysOps, Data Engineer etc. type certs.

But what certs are the jobs you're looking at asking for?

Do you have a college degree? It's really hard for recruiters to see scripting, Python, and bash skills if you don't have any creds that back it up. If you're looking at roles that typically require something like at IT BS, they're going to expect you to have foundational skills in databases, software, networking, cyber at a mid-intermediate cert equivalent level depending on your specialization.

Resume feedback I’ve been working on my resume since July and have applied to probably 30 jobs and only received 1 call back/interview. I asked for advice here, got roasted for my resume that was provided by a professional service lol but I did take that feedback and reworked it using the Jake overleaf template which is highly recommended here and tried to remove a lot of fluff.


I’m still struggling with what exactly to include and not include, but hopefully here is where I can get some further feedback!

Me personally I love scripting/development/automation that’s where my passion lies and I’m always looking for ways to make us more efficient but our team and manager hates it so I fail to get any traction on those initiatives. I honestly find lots of the classic systems admin related tasks boring like patching, endpoint management, backups etc. not gonna lie, at least the way we do it here. Saying that, I’ve gained lots of valuable experience here across so many different systems and completed a bunch of projects but I want to move on and continue learning (plus the $$$)


Ideally I would love to move into some DevOps role or really any role where I can use my programming skillset and come up with solutions, but I lack experience with Linux and some more enterprise DevOps tools. So realistically I would be totally fine still being a systems guy short term because I’m severely underpaid in a HCOL, there are job listings showing 90-100k+ while I’m at 70k. So the question(s) is what can I do at my current job to make myself more DevOps qualified?

I'm at a crossroads in my career and would love to get some advice from the community. I've been in the tech industry for several years, starting out as a web developer but have since transitioned into roles focused on IT administration, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity.

While I have a background in coding, I've realized that I'm not passionate about full-time software development. I much prefer working on infrastructure, solving operational problems, and focusing on security and system stability.

My main question is: **What career paths should I be seriously considering that don't revolve around development?**

I'd be grateful for any tips or suggestions you might have, specifically on:

1. Specific job titles or career paths that you think are a strong fit.
2. Valuable certifications that would help me specialize further in one of these areas.

ndv6em8,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"nan Titles on the less-developer side get wishy washy. There's a few kinds of ""Architect"". I'm going to outline three.

""Enterprise Architect"" has TOGAF and possibly no technical skills. They are good at getting agreement between all the penny pinchers and executives so that by the time work is ordered it's funded and planned properly and everyone agrees on what success would look like.

""Solution Architect"" has limited technical awareness and can look at where we are, see where we need to go, and lay out a plan of attack for getting it done, put that all in JIRA, and be the SME the implementation team relies on to answer questions when they don't understand a bit of work. ""Why aren't we just using MQue instead of Kafka?"" ""There's two 'intake' repos, why is that? Oh one's the external data model and the internal data model. So if I see familiar variable names I'm in the right one (internal). Got it.""

The last kind of architect I don't have a name for, but employers want to have someone like you who can actually do shit and prototype or mock up stuff, then lay out the plan of attack for the implementation team to build it. I'd argue this is typically for smaller businesses who don't want to have all the layers, and they're kind of combining the tech lead and the business/tech interface ""architect"" into the same role.

1negexr,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"How to deal with imposter syndrome in IT? Recently I have been interviewing for a security focused sysadmin job where I would mainly be doing work in splunk and defender for endpoint (which I have used before) while acting as the level above the Helpdesk/service desk staff it’s supposed to be an entry E3 sysadmin role in a regulated industry and I think I’m getting like imposter syndrome bad.

The first interview went great, the executive team told me that I had a great interview and were impressed by my resume and my ability to articulate my experience. I have the second interview with even more of the executive team coming up but I feel like I’m psyching myself out. 

For reference my current role was my first role in IT(?) and it handles integrating hardware/software solutions like server and cloud based saas products into client preexisting environments. it’s a golden handcuffs scenario where I make ok money but I’m doing work that to me is easy and boring not fulfilling at all.

 There’s a separation of duties out of liability so I don’t touch things like the clients AD or switch ports and security policies. I may suggest things to a client like “oh did you check the root CA certificate setting ” or something like that. But I spend pretty much all my time doing IT work trouble shooting things etc I even did remote support for the company for 6m - 1 year.

My current role is super demanding some days I’m driving 6 hours in a day, but to not lose momentum I will get up at 4am to continue to self study and days I’m WFH I study almost the entire day if I’m not getting tickets or anything and I’ve been doing this on and off for going on 3 years alongside a wfh internship at a SOC that I can do as I please. I have a big home lab I’ve built (parts below if you’re interested) and I still don’t know how to use everything in it but I want to.

But even though I have certifications, a degree, experience, a GitHub with a bunch of projects, a robust homelab an internship even a top 1% international ranking in TryHackMe, all of that. I still feel like I’m going to fail or that I know nothing. I made mental notes of the way they said their infrastructure was set up during the interview and bought a bunch of things to mimic it so I can feel more competent but I haven’t gotten that feeling yet 





So how do you all deal with imposter syndrome? Anyone find the cure lol?

1neaxue,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"Question about gaps in resume About 3 years ago I began building the experience and certs that I thought would be necessary to find an entry-level help desk role.

I've recently moved to another state, but I want to give it another shot while I continue building certs and skills.

1nea66b,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"I need support, why are entry level IT interviews brutal? Hi, I need support and if you don't have anything nice to say I ask you to please not share that here with me.

I just bombed my second ever IT interview and I'm crushed. Here's the backstory. 20 years ago I graduated from RIT with a 4 yr B.S. degree in IT. My first interview out of college I bombed a math test. One of the interviewers enter the room, sat down, and she immediately told me my math test was awful I'd never work in IT again. To this day I remember that vividly. I avoided IT like the plague after having my confidence crushed.

Fast forward to a years ago, the industry I worked in collapsed and I had to make a career transition. After much thought and research, knowing full well IT was a difficult job market, I decided to try again to enter the field. I had an IT degree, I could get certifications to get current on the tech, and my previous jobs had overlap in skills and work experiences. It logically made sense to me to go for IT.

Last summer I got my A+ and Network+ certifications and applied to about 60+ jobs but landed no interviews. I took a break and started applying to IT jobs again earlier this year.

This past week, I landed my first interview for a Junior level IT Support role at an MSP. ""Junior"" was in the job title and the role came with lots of onboarding, training, and benefits supporting professional growth.

The interviewer asked me 4 different ways to talk about my weaknesses. By the 4th time, I ran out of things to say and decided to talk about how I could improve on my Active Directory and Networking skills. 

I had earlier talked to her about an Active Directory project for which I had sent in my application a YouTube demo video showing I know I create new users. I also talked about a networking project where I setup my Win 11 laptop with VMware and unbuntu to create a web server. Additionally, the web server was nginx, and I used dynamic DNS routing to hook up my domain name to my router, then used port forwarding to connect requests to my laptop web server. I told her that earlier in the interview. But when she wanted me to tell her for fourth time about my weaknesses I threw in the AD and Networking because of course there's more I can learn. In IT there's always more you can learn! That's what I love about it.

Well, I asked for feedback after the rejection email and thankfully she gave it. One of the feedback was that I said I was weak in Active Directory and Networking despite having certifications in those areas. Not sure where she got I was certified in Active Directory, but whatever.

The four questions related to weaknesses were:  
1) Tell me about your strengths and weaknesses  
2) Tell me how your last supervisor would rate you, why, and what would they say you need to work on to improve?  
3) A repeat of number 2 for a different job role  
4) What are your technical weaknesses?

I'm really upset because on one hand, I know I need to sell myself better, but I \_hate\_ doing that. My natural being is to be authentic. So many people have told me they value my authenticity.

1ndzjyj,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"Graduating soon, advice? (Long post) Hello, I am 23 and will be graduating soon with a BS in Economics from a larger university in my state, located in a major city. The school isn't ranked extremely high, but it is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the state's largest city, next to Madison, WI. I am hoping to get into a tech-related field, but I will graduate in December 2025, so I am currently looking for jobs but still four motnhs out from graduation.

As I mentioned earlier, I have, or will have, a BS in Economics, not a tech-related degree. I suppose when I started college, I didn't think about the field, but by the time I had an interest in it, changing would have only set me back in credits and would have cost more money, so it didn't seem worth it. I plan on doing the CompTIA A+ certification, CompTIA Network+, then last the Cisco CCNA certification to up my resume.

Speaking of resumes, I will also briefly cover mine. My first internship was in fact an IT role. I was a paid intern for a help desk, which primarily involved learning how to respond to tickets, installing phones, TVs, and new monitors, as well as setting up desks for individuals relocating to a new office. It was fairly surface-level, but it provided some good general knowledge. This is followed by an internship at my state's capital, where I worked in someone's office for a year, assisting with campaigns, answering the phone, writing and creating bills, and performing other tasks in an office setting. Not IT related but gave a very good sense of an office and get better with of how to work with Windows, as up until that point I had mainly used Mac all my life. The last two are an Aldi District manager internship, where I worked in a business setting with a District manager who manages a number of stores. Again, not IT, but it's a good internship for a large company in the US, so it's a good experience. In addition to these, I've worked as a line cook since around 17 (now 23), and that's how I've paid my way through school. I don't list all those ive worked at, as they're not really relevant to the job I want. Just the one I'm currently working at for about a year up to now.

Please let me know your thoughts on how I can improve my resume and experience, and whether obtaining these certifications is feasible before graduating in 5 months or worthwhile. I have started looking into homelabs to gain more knowledge as well as started using Linux Mint as my daily driver to gain a better understanding of that OS, so I can at least understand all, and I know many servers run on Linux.

1ndfa98,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"What do you do when you are trying to advance your career but your current job doesn't give you the opportunity? This got a bit ranty so here's the TL;DR

How do you advance your career when your current job doesn't give you the opportunity or hell even a title change? 

Full Version:
Hey all, I've been struggling with this for the past 4 years I've been at my current company going on 7 now. The first 3 years was just doing my primary Helpdesk work getting to know the systems and seeing where I could help out or pick up the slack.

I've been trying to get on the system engineering team for those 4 years and each time it felt like a dangling carrot in front of my face type scenario when it came down to my year end performance review. It always came down to the amount of tickets closed and consistency. In the company I'm known to be the ""go to guy"" despite there being 3 other techs + my manager on the team. 

One of the techs is very old school and doesn't like change and stays in his lane and takes a lot of the low hanging fruit tickets.

The other 2 techs are right up there with me willing to adapt to changes in the company and make documentation out of it and communicate and knowledge share. Make jokes of the madness of changes that happen on our group policy right as our users are logging in for the morning 

For me I'm the forbidden term ""jack of all trades, master of none"" where my tech knowledge ranges from simple break and fix, to reverse engineering / infosec

System engineers come to me first whenever there is a new application being requested by our users or if I've heard of it before. One of the reasons being is python really started picking up in my company and NO ONE else was taking those tickets. So I took it up on myself to take those tickets and use it as a good way to get better in my scripting language in both python and powershell (Which it did!), or they come to me first to use for testing new GPOs or deployments

I tend to acquire tools that engineers use (firewall logs, error logs, etc) so that when we have one of those tickets that pop up with an error that we've never seen before I bring you a dossier of info as to what broke, why it broke, and where it broke.

The problem came down to me taking those python tickets, because I was the only one working on them and since I was new to it, it took me a lot longer than usual to resolve the issue. Despite the quality of work and tickets I put in I was told I wasn't closing enough tickets. And I'm neglecting my primary job as Helpdesk analyst

Eventually I became the ""python guy"" of the office and at one point there was talk of creating a position for me specifically for all this FinTech that was coming about.

But... Once again because I resolved those tickets and streamlined a lot of the issues and they didn't come up as often. So, upper management didn't see the need for that ""new position"" anymore for me...

So my question to you all is... How do you advance your career when your current job doesn't give you the opportunity or hell even a title change? 

As I'm applying for jobs I hear conflicting narration that certs are ok on the resume but they want someone with HANDS ON ENTERPRISE LEVEL EXPERIENCE!

Okay I do that, but unfortunately my homelab doesn't count? I have a proxmox server, with lxc containers, opnsense, and dual booting Ubuntu on my laptop.

How can I get enterprise experience if my company isn't willing to give me the shot?

I don't want to lie on my resume... when I look at some job descriptions I feel like I have such a knowledge gap! So I do my best to try to fill that knowledge gap with my homelab but again...that still doesn't count!

Do I just do a career change at this point?

1nd44vl,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"28 and feeling stuck in my IT career I’m 28 and working as an IT Cloud Systems Admin (that’s the title they gave me, not even sure if it’s accurate). Making low 70s. I started my career in 2020 with 2 years in technical support, then a year in IT support, and now I’ve been at this last job almost 2 years. I was first hired as an IT Administrator and then they changed my title to IT Cloud Systems Admin.

Day to day I do literally everything Microsoft related (onboarding and offboarding, IT orientation for new hires, imaging and shipping laptops, creating users in Entra ID, assigning M365 licenses, MFA and conditional access, Teams/SharePoint/Exchange, SSO setups, email security, some Power Automate). I also use a lot of remote PowerShell and CMD since we don’t have Intune so I’m always finding workarounds to push apps and updates. On top of that I deal with iPads in MaaS360, some basic firewall/VM stuff (this is my weakness due to always have been remote and never had the chance to set up a local server. We have an MSP that assists us with the networking at the local office since I’m remote), and help desk. Basically I’m IT guy here.

I’ve got A+, Net+, Sec+, AZ-104 and the MS-700. I like the job but honestly I feel stuck.

Please be brutally honest and I appreciate some tough love. What should I actually do next if I want to make 6-figures? Keep stacking Azure certs (AZ-305)? Learn Terraform/Bicep? DevOps tools, containers? Or should I slow down and go back to fill the networking gaps I skipped?

1ngv8uz,Tech,cybersecurity,"Unveiling the Umbrella Intelligence Platform Backend: Executive Security at Your Fingertips **Unleashing the Umbrella Intelligence Platform Backend: Executive Security Dashboard Powered by Xano & Cisco Umbrella – SQL Schemas Now on GitHub!**

Hey r/dataengineering, r/cybersecurity, and r/webdev community!

We're incredibly excited to share a deep dive into a project we've been working on: the **Umbrella Intelligence Platform Backend**. This isn't just another backend; it's a dedicated, **multi-tenant data platform** designed from the ground up to power an executive-grade security intelligence dashboard. Our goal is to revolutionize how leaders understand and act on cybersecurity posture.

# The Core Vision: Actionable Intelligence, Not Just Data

In today's fast-evolving threat landscape, executives need more than just raw security logs. Our platform aims to **""fuse posture at a glance with deep, analyst-level drill-downs and an AI narrative that tells leaders what changed, why it matters, and what to do next""**. This means transforming high-volume security telemetry into clear, prioritized, and actionable insights.

The platform's **Phase 1 scope** focuses on critical areas:

* **Threats**: Understanding current and evolving attack vectors.
* **KPIs**: Key performance indicators for a quick security health check.
* **Heatmaps**: Visualizing attack patterns by hour, day, and category.
* **Top-N Lists**: Identifying the most impacted identities, domains, and applications.
* **Shadow-IT**: Gaining visibility and risk assessment for unsanctioned applications.
* **Roaming Client Outdated Status**: Monitoring endpoint health and coverage.
* **AI Narrative**: Providing intelligent summaries and recommendations tailored for leadership.

# Under the Hood: Built on Xano (PostgreSQL)

The entire backend is developed using **Xano's robust PostgreSQL capabilities**. This choice provides a powerful, scalable foundation for complex data processing and API exposure. Our architecture follows a clear pipeline: **Ingestion → Enrichment (Umbrella Investigate) → Core (dimensions/facts) → Weekly Gold Marts → AI layer → Public APIs**.

# 1. Layered Data Model: From Raw Logs to Gold Insights

A cornerstone of our design is a meticulously structured, **layered schema strategy**. We manage data through five distinct schemas, each serving a critical role:

* `meta` **Schema**: This is our operational control center. It holds metadata for tenants (`meta.tenants`), ingestion runs (`meta.ingest_runs`), data quality violations (`meta.dq_violations`), and API audit logs (`audit_api_calls`).
* `raw` **Schema (Bronze Layer)**: This is where raw, untouched telemetry lands directly from **Cisco Umbrella Reports v2 + Investigate APIs**. Tables like `raw.raw_dns_activity` store 1:1 payloads, including control fields (`_hash`, `schema_version`, `ingested_at`, `src_batch_id`) to ensure **idempotent upserts** and enable historical backfills. We even have a `raw.raw_dlq` (dead-letter queue) for malformed records.
* `core` **Schema (Silver Layer)**: Here, the raw data is cleaned, normalized, and integrated. We build a robust **star schema** with granular facts (e.g., `core.fact_dns_activity_15m`, `core.fact_casb_app_usage_daily`) and detailed dimensions (e.g., `core.dim_identity` which supports **Slowly Changing Dimensions Type 2 - SCD2** for historical tracking, `core.dim_domain`, `core.dim_category`).
* `mart` **Schema (Gold Layer)**: These are our ""weekly gold marts"". These tables contain highly **read-optimized aggregates**, materialized nightly, designed to directly feed the executive dashboard's KPIs, trends, and top lists. Examples include `mart.weekly_kpis_umbrella` for high-level metrics, `mart.risk_semaphore_weekly` for quick risk assessments, and `mart.top_identities_weekly` / `mart.top_domains_weekly` for leaderboards.
* `ai` **Schema (Governed Layer)**: This schema stores outputs from our **provider-agnostic AI layer**. It includes statistical baselines (`ai.baselines`) for anomaly detection, `ai.insights`, `ai.recommendations` (as deterministic, schema-validated JSON), and `ai.weekly_exec` for the executive summaries and narratives.

# Developers & Data Pros: Get Your Hands on the SQL Schemas!

For those who want to see the exact table structures, column definitions, and indexing strategies, the complete **SQL DDL (Data Definition Language) schemas are available directly in our GitHub repository!** You'll find modular files for each layer, such as:

* `07_DDL_Core.sql` (for dimensions, facts, bridges)
* `08_DDL_Marts.sql` (for weekly/report marts)
* `09_DDL_Raw.sql` (for raw ingested data)
* `10_DDL_Ai.sql` (for AI-generated insights)
* `11_Indexing_Retention.sql` (detailing indexes, BRIN, partitioning, and retention helpers)

This modular approach allows you to directly import them into your Xano/PostgreSQL instance or review them for a deeper understanding of our data model. We believe in keeping **""everything in Git and version DDL using migrations""**.

# 2. ETL/ELT & Scheduling: The Automated Data Engine

Our data pipelines are robust and automated using **Xano's Background Tasks (crons)**:

* **Hourly Crons**: Handle continuous data ingestion from Umbrella streams (DNS activity, identities, roaming clients, CASB daily data), aggregate to CORE 15-minute/daily facts, and recompute AI baselines and current-week toplists/heatmaps.
* **Nightly Jobs**: Focus on resource-intensive tasks such as **Umbrella Investigate domain enrichment** (with rate-limiting and exponential backoff) and the crucial **materialization of all ""gold marts""**.
* **Idempotency & DLQ**: We ensure data integrity with `UPSERT by (tenant_id, natural_id) with _hash` and utilize a `raw.raw_dlq` for malformed records.

# 3. API Design (Public): Powering the Dashboard Seamlessly

The backend exposes **Bubble-ready, versioned REST APIs** (`/v1`) with predictable JSON response contracts.

* **Strict Multitenancy**: Every endpoint enforces a **""tenant guard"" middleware**, ensuring strict data isolation by injecting a `tenant_id` filter into every query.
* **Caching**: We implement **ETag/If-None-Match with a TTL of 60–300 seconds** to optimize performance. A private webhook invalidates frontend caches after nightly mart materialization.
* **Standard Contracts**: List endpoints return a standardized envelope `{ ""items"": [ ... ], ""meta"": { ... } }`for easy frontend consumption.

**Key Phase 1 Public Endpoints include:**

* `/v1/umbrella/kpis-weekly`: Get executive KPI cards.
* `/v1/ai/weekly-exec`: Fetch the AI-generated executive narrative.
* `/v1/umbrella/top-domains`: Discover top malicious destinations.
* `/v1/shadow-it/top-apps`: Gain visibility into high-risk Shadow-IT applications.
* `/v1/umbrella/infra/status`: Check unified infrastructure health.

# Non-Functional Excellence: Performance, Security, and Quality

We've set high **Non-Functional Requirements (SLOs)** to guarantee an executive-grade experience:

* **Latency**: P95 < 500 ms for mart endpoints; P95 < 1.5 s for heavy Top-N/detail joins.
* **Freshness**: Hourly for 15-min/daily facts; weekly marts materialized nightly; current-week trends/heatmaps/toplists refreshed hourly.
* **Availability**: ≥ 99.5% for public read APIs.
* **Retention**: Facts for 90 days; marts for 24 months (per-tenant configurable).

**Security & Multitenancy** are paramount:

* **Every table is keyed by** `tenant_id`.
* **Secrets** (e.g., Umbrella, Investigate API keys) are stored in **environment variables**, rotated regularly, and scoped with **least privilege**.
* **PII minimization** includes hashing WHOIS emails.
* **Auditing and rate limiting** are implemented via `audit_api_calls` and circuit breakers on repeated Cisco 429/5xx errors.
* **Row-Level Security (RLS)** policies on PostgreSQL are recommended for defense-in-depth.

**Observability & Data Quality** ensure trust in the data:

* We instrument ingestion/transforms with **run logs, metrics (rows/sec, lag, duplicates %, error rate)**, and alerts.
* **Data Quality (DQ) checks** include totals reconciliation (allowed+blocked=total), identity/domain cardinalities, RC active coverage %, and freshness checks for Investigate enrichment.
* **Runbooks** are defined for remediation of DQ violations and operational recovery (e.g., backfills, handling throttling).

# The Road Ahead: Phase 2 and Beyond

Our roadmap for **Phase 2** includes exciting enhancements:

* **Controls & Policy**: End-to-end controls funnel and policy simulation APIs.
* **Visual Analytics**: Advanced Sankey and Sunburst diagrams for deeper insights.
* **SWG/CDFW Support**: Expanding analysis for Secure Web Gateway and Cloud Delivered Firewall events.
* **Incident Response**: Optional integration for local incidents and SLA tracking.
* **Benchmarks & Policy Diff**: Industry benchmarking and policy ""diff"" views.

ndxncz9,Tech,cybersecurity,"nan Breach Context. I just wrote an article on this topic. Without a real understanding of risk (and these days risk essentially means breach/ransomware) you can’t secure and environment effectively. A vuln scan will give you information, but it is a check list to remediate. It doesn’t tell you why these things matter or place them in the context of an APT event. 

If you are serious about security the #1 thing that matters is garaunteed recovery.  Secure backups with true immutability (not a two-key turn, not a vendor back door, not AWS governance mode, not software immutability on the backup console but nothing on the backup target) managed on a segmented identity plane with strong MFA and segmented from user networks is where strong security starts. 

Remember, anything an admin can do, a threat actor can do. Thats why immutable backups are key. And admin cannot delete or encrypt them, so a TA cannot either. 

The goal of most ransomware attacks is to encrypt data and destroy backups for force a payment. If your backups survive, the TA loses their leverage. 

To regain that leverage TA use data exfiltration so they can threaten blackmail for payment. Sometimes exfil is the end goal, but it is usually used to help force a payment. But exfil takes time. With the right tools in place it can be detected but I rarely see strong exfil controls. Depending on your business (law firms handling sensitive data, for example) exfil can be a massive risk. If this is that case for you, DLP may become priority 2 from a beach context perspective. 

In reality DLP tooling will end up as a lower priority item if your org has more pressing issues like weak lateral movement controls and domain-joined infrastructure, backup, and security consoles.  Get that stuff out of the domain and segment it. That is critical. Same with your PAM tool. The first targets after a TA breaches are AD/Entra, and password vaults. These are the key components to widening a breach. Focus on securing them. 

I could go on like this for a while, but the key point that answers your question is to contextualize your security work from the perspective of a breach.

Following the short-lived and unsuccessful Steam Machine mini-PCs more than a decade ago, few would have expected Valve to return to the home console market. But the Steam Deck and SteamOS Linux distro have proved big hits, with the latter being used by third-party developers such as Lenovo.

In December, a Steam Deck kernel update referenced a device codenamed ""Fremont"" that features an HDMI port connected directly to a graphics chip, suggesting it is a standalone TV box, not a new Steam Deck dock.

Now, Brad Lynch, the original Fremont leaker, has spotted the machine on Geekbench. It is described as a six-core APU with a maximum boost clock of around 4.8GHz. It's listed as being from the Hawk Point 2 family. That's the Ryzen 8000G desktop APUs, Ryzen 8040 mobile, and Ryzen 200 mobile chips, all of which use Zen 4 cores and RDNA 3 iGPUs.

According to the Geekbench JSON entry, Fremont has what could be a dedicated Radeon RX 7600 series GPU, so we could be looking at a Navi 33-based GPU with 32 Compute Units and 8GB of memory.

Lynch writes that the processor in Fremont is semi-custom with a removed iGPU, and that the console will have a discrete RX 7600 that won't share RAM with the SoC. The hardware will be packed into a custom case and use a customized Valve motherboard.

He adds that Fremont will come with the Ibex gamepad that was leaked in the SteamVR driver files alongside the Roy controllers for the rumored Valve Deckard XR headset.",['linux'],from the article valves steam machinelike device that first surfaced in december has just been spotted on geekbench codenamed fremont the amdpowered console appears to pack a customized apu featuring six zen cores alongside a radeon rx gpu following the shortlived and unsuccessful steam machine minipcs more than a decade ago few would have expected valve to return to the home console market but the steam deck and steamos linux distro have proved big hits with the latter being used by thirdparty developers such as lenovo in december a steam deck kernel update referenced a device codenamed fremont that features an hdmi port connected directly to a graphics chip suggesting it is a standalone tv box not a new steam deck dock now brad lynch the original fremont leaker has spotted the machine on geekbench it is described as a sixcore apu with a maximum boost clock of around ghz its listed as being from the hawk point family thats the ryzen g desktop apus ryzen mobile and ryzen mobile chips all of which use zen cores and rdna igpus according to the geekbench json entry fremont has what could be a dedicated radeon rx series gpu so we could be looking at a navi based gpu with compute units and gb of memory lynch writes that the processor in fremont is semicustom with a removed igpu and that the console will have a discrete rx that wont share ram with the soc the hardware will be packed into a custom case and use a customized valve motherboard he adds that fremont will come with the ibex gamepad that was leaked in the steamvr driver files alongside the roy controllers for the rumored valve deckard xr headset,positive

For a long time, I liked Apple’s branding as the “privacy-first” tech company. But the $95 million lawsuit surrounding Siri really shook my trust. If Apple had been more transparent about its limits, I might not have cared. But because privacy is such a big part of their image, the lawsuit raised real concerns for me.

That’s when I left my iPhone for a dumb phone. I’m more worried about privacy now than ever. I don’t fully understand metadata, but I do know I was constantly feeding information into my Maps app. It learned the places I frequented and could predict where I was heading just based on the time of day. That felt too invasive.

And while it’s almost a meme at this point, I can’t shake the moments when it feels like companies are listening in. Maybe it’s just the yellow punch buggy effect, but after the Siri lawsuit, I no longer trust Apple enough to brush those things off.

I’m not saying Apple makes bad products. They make excellent hardware and software. But for me, I’d rather trade convenience for peace of mind. That’s why I went back to a dumb phone, and eventually I’ll move my Mac over to Linux after I finish my dissertation.

Again, this is just my perspective. I’d really like to know if others have had similar concerns or different experiences with Apple’s approach to privacy.

I've configured sshd to only accept pubkey authentication, using ed25519 passord protected keys, using nftables as firewall to allow incoming connection only from specific ports and the server is running the latest available ubuntu image if that's relevant.

Is there any way to allow traffic only from the UK or something else I could do prevent this from happening? I am worried that with so many attempts, eventually someone might be able to actually break-in. Thoughts, suggestions?

Backward compatibility is a key reason for x86's popularity. Advanced vector and floating-point instructions have recently been added to the x86 instruction set, but they are primarily used by user applications, not the Linux kernel. If a new instruction is relevant to kernel operations, its support is prioritized and added to the kernel, often with contributions from Intel and AMD engineers.


Secondly, the majority of embedded systems run on ARM SoCs, which are supported by a straightforward device tree mechanism. These device trees for ARM SoCs are typically provided by the vendors themselves, given Linux's dominance in the embedded world. The Apple M1 device tree, for example, was added by volunteers because Apple focuses on FreeBSD rather than Linux. Support for Qualcomm ARM laptops is in early stages, as they use ACPI (like x86 laptops, desktops, and servers) instead of the ARM device tree mechanism. Support for ARM ACPI is in progress.


Yes, Wi-Fi and camera drivers for new laptops pose challenges, but these components are technically not part of the SoC. Additionally, Wi-Fi and cameras are not needed in server environments, so vendors like Red Hat don’t prioritize open-source drivers for them.

ne3z1ll,Tech,linux,"nan When I first tried it maybe 12ish years ago, installing it was totally manual, one had to follow the wiki to install it but the wiki wasn't as complete as it has been in recent years and you had to jump around a lot and make decisions about things that people don't usually develop expertise in. Other distros usually give a install program or script that gets you up and running quickly.

Reflecting on the experience, it was probably a good way in order to get a user familiar wiht the wiki and to use it as a first source of information. However, I usually don't care about things like whether I should use GPT or MBR or whatever and I want to use a system for programming, not building a custom distro. I'm sure others have different preferences than me and that's OK.

A few years later I gave it another chance. The install process had improved somewhat and the wiki was better organized and the installation flow was more streamlined. Unfortunately, I often had difficulty when doing a system update every month or 2 and the system would break in strange ways and digging around to find an answer can take time, especially if it was a new problem that hadn't sprea around much and gained the proper attention. I got tired of this and went back to old faithful Debian and haven't looked back.

Some people seem to really love it, but I'm not one of them. It just gets in my way. Perhaps some may consider me a noob, but I've been doing system programming on Unix based systems since the mid 80's, been using Linux since '91, have done extensive application development on Linux, and even written a kernel level device driver for a custom image processing board in the late 90's.

ne4pta0,Tech,linux,"nan >Where is this reputation coming from?

This is mainly due to the myths that have arisen around Arch and most of which are nonsense, which are spread deliberately by some users (showing off, gatekeeping) and unintentionally by others (because they simply parrot something without having any experience of it themselves).

One of the myths, for example, is that you generally learn more with Arch than with other distributions. This leads to users wanting to use the ‘do-it-yourself’ Arch distribution, but not wanting to do DIY (e.g. reading documentation or using search engines) or being overwhelmed by it. By the way, this myth is not true. The only important thing is that you want to learn something. It doesn't really matter which distribution you use. For example, I acquired a large part of my Linux knowledge using Mandrake / Mandriva. That was, so to speak, the Ubuntu of its time.

And that's what I don't understand. Why do some users feel the urge to use things that aren't suitable for them? Let's take me as an example. The vim editor isn't suitable for me, or I'm not suitable for this editor. Does that bother me? Do I demand that the editor support shortcuts such as CTRL+S, for example? No. I just use a different editor.

1ng5gm9,Tech,linux,"Simple External Drive Snapshot Backups Using rsync and ZFS I wanted to mirror an 8TB XFS-formatted local SSD to an external 8TB USB drive to protect against drive failure.  I don't like btrfs, but I still wanted snapshots on the backup drive.  This is how I did it:

sudo apt install zfsutils-linux  
sudo apt install zfs-dkms -y  
sudo apt install zfs-auto-snapshot

Reboot, then:

sudo zpool create backuppool /dev/sdb (use your drive device path, check lsblk)  
sudo zfs create backuppool/backupdata  
sudo zfs set mountpoint=/backup backuppool/backupdata  
sudo zfs set compression=zstd backuppool/backupdata

Check that /backup exists etc.  Then as root, these cron entries will create and retain 8 weekly snapshots. Right after each snapshot, this will initiate an rsync update from primary to secondary.  

crontab -e

15 0 \* \* 1 root flock -n /var/run/zfs-auto-snapshot.lock sh -c 'LOCAL\_TIME=$(date +\\%Y\_\\%m\_\\%d\_\\%H\\%M); zfs-auto-snapshot --syslog --label=weekly\_${LOCAL\_TIME} --keep=8 // 2>/var/log/zfs-snapshots.log'

15 1 \* \* 1 rsync -avhH --delete /primarydatapath /backup >/dev/null 2>&1

  
NOTES:    
  
Using zfs-19 compression buried the processor, so I swapped to regular zstd.  Using the new ""quick dedupe"" in ZFS 2.3+ also buried the processor, so I'm not using that either.  I briefly considered disabling speedstep which would have capped the processor at 2.2ghz (down from 3.8) to keep the temps down, but I only cared about getting enough savings to provide snapshot space.  Against 5TB of video and picture data, I'm at 1.3:1 savings.  You can view the compression via:

zfs get compressratio backuppool/backupdata

You can access snapshots in /backuppool/.zfs/snapshot.  Also, optional, you can disable the automatically installed snapshot schedules from zfs-auto-snapshot by removing the following files so that you only take the weekly snapshots in the cron job above.  I don't have any data change other than the rsync, so these snapshots were pointless for me:

\# find . | grep zfs | grep snap | grep cron

./cron.daily/zfs-auto-snapshot  
./cron.weekly/zfs-auto-snapshot  
./cron.monthly/zfs-auto-snapshot

1nfabc0,Tech,linux,"I want to show my appreciation for linux My interest in computers generally started when I was 7, with an old laptop running Windows 7. it was slow and all but somehow I learned how to install programs and stuff using it but I quickly got curious about how everything actually worked. That curiosity led me down a rabbit hole.

Before I even understood what Linux was, I was already deep into Android modding and iOS jailbreaking. I had reached 9 years old, I was flashing custom ROMs and unlocking bootloaders of old android phones lying around and what I didn’t realize at the time was that all of this came from Linux and an open-source mindset. the idea of freedom, control, and pushing devices beyond what they were ""supposed"" to do kinda fascinated me

Eventually, I discovered Linux itself. That completely changed how I saw software.  started by running Ubuntu on old laptops, to eventually learning how to compile kernels and getting frustrated. Linux taught me about how computers work beyond just windows.

As I got deeper into it, I started exploring embedded devices and hardware-level mods. I’ve repurposed old routers with openwrt; experimented with running lightweight distros on raspberry pi and even built a server from an old laptop. I’ve also done hardware mods just for the challenge  like building Hackintoshes (which taught me about EFI) and opening up devices to replace Wi-Fi cards, BIOS chips, or even reflash firmware manually. I’ve bricked and fixed my fair share of devices, but that's how I learned by breaking things and figuring out how to recover them.

Now, I run an Arch Linux server and media server. Almost every device I own has run Linux at some point.  If i see Macos or Windows anywhere it'll kinda piss me off about how Microsoft or Apple doesn't allow freedom to users Everything I have done isn't even the tip of the iceberg of what linux is but seriously i think linux is the coolest thing.

This entire post sounds kinda weird but Im really grateful. I’m super thankful for the Linux and open-source community.

I think I got my first laptop at the age of 8. Around that time, I also learned how to use a soldering iron. At some point, I somehow acquired an Arduino board (I don’t remember how), and I learned how to write in C/C++. From that point on, it was mostly that. Along the way, I also designed and soldered some PCBs (including SMD components). I modified FreeRTOS to suit my needs (on an ATmega2560, with some assembly), and I wrote a file system with fragmentation and other features (linked-list style, although I didn’t even know that concept existed back then). I also did some plugin coding in Java for PaperMC Folia, but I don’t really like languages that keep you away from raw memory. I even hosted some things after managing to get a public IP.

nds0zec,Tech,linux,"nan Linux is the kernel. Colloquially, any whole operating system based on linux is also called Linux. 

A distro is a bundle of software. It bundles the linux kernel, shell, package manager, and other packages you might need to operate your computer.

A distro may or may not come with a GUI. The server distros and minimal distros like Arch are often shipped without a GUI, and you're free to install any desktop or none at all. 

A desktop environment is a collection of packages that gives you a GUI with a window manager and a set of default apps like text editors, terminal emulators, web browsers, etc.

1ne49bg,Tech,linux,"I use Linux since exactly 1 year - and I understand now! As the title says, I am ""daily driving"" Linux now since one year and I am so glad that I did switch. Okay, I am DualBooting for getting the best from both worlds, but I also built my PC (I usually overspecc my rigs so they last for 5+ years) with DualBoot in mind because I thought I will have to. If I'd have known how much I enjoy Linux (Mint) I'd given the Windows installation less storage and the regular SATA (on the other hand, giving that bloat OS the expensive nvme SSD might be the better option...). 

Anyways, as one who switched to OSX in 2008 after the Vista debacle and coming back for Win7, I finally decided it's enough of Windows and the exponentially growing issues about Windows. I tried Ubuntu in 2010 and even bought magazines but hardware support was basically non-existant for my computers so I had a very crippled time trying it out. In fact, the last Mint Live system in 2024 had no sound and just when I planned my new PC, my SoundBlaster Z was recognized by the LiveDisk and I could finally order my PC.

Now let's be real: I traded in Windows issues with some Linux issues. I miss a real indexed file search like Everything or Spotlight. I have audio crackling which is a known issue, no matter how many ALSA updates happen. It's sometimes so strong I have eardrum-shattering noise for like 30 seconds straight until the actual audio builds up again. I tried the quantum changes in the config but nothing changes. I also hate the lack of fractional scaling under Mint, the (to me) unusable Wayland alpha state (boots me into a blackscreen), the fact I can't use my Ryzen's iGPU (boots me into blackscreen) and I really miss DirectX where sound and graphics ""just work"" since the mid-90s. But after diving into the Linux world and thus read more about the whole ""movement"" surrounding FOSS and Linux, I did not only start to understand - I also can tolerate these issues now knowing more about it.

Using Linux takes months to see its full potential. And the more I boot up Mint, the more I notice how Windows annoys me. I have a Windows laptop (Acer Nitro gaming laptop at my parent's house) which is constantly spinning its fans when plugged in just to see like 5 different Microsoft services using my hardware. (And no, it's not the file indexer ;) If I leave my desktop PC just for the bathroom, I can hear the fans spin up too because MS uses these ""idle times"" to do something on my PC, and it bugs me. If your control panel consists of ads for Office suites, penetrant Cloud services, unwanted CoPilot AI, no wonder why things require RAM, disk space and CPU power. When I leave Linux alone, it just sits there quietly like a trusty Golden Retriever waiting for commands.

Updates are so transparent with Mint displaying changelogs (except for Flatpaks sadly), the option to ignore updates and so many updates just happen without reboot that I am still amazed by that. I have control of what my PC is ""eating"" - most of the time low-calorie but high result ones, not being spoonfed Microsoft Updates with intransparent, super slow, high-calorie fake food.

I love Cinnamon very much, as I like how Windows is being used and looks (taskbar, Alt+Tabbing, Cinnamenu upon Windows key push, ...), so have that on top of a clean, fast, safe OS is basically exactly of what I could have dreamed of. So many QoL improvements (e.g. selecting several files bringing up Bulky for mass-rename rules - on Windows I had to install ""Bulk Rename Utility"" or the ALSAMIXER talking to my SoundBlaster natively to set up EQ settings - on Windows, ""Creative Command"" had to be installed, a 110 MByte tool in Startup!). Coupled with my favourite theme Mint looks great, works amazing and has the Linux engine (figuratively spoken) underneath. Fantastic. 

The biggest straw was of course Recall. My CPU (and GPU?) power used to create screenshots of my bank statements while online banking to be a) send to MS servers in the USA where it can be accessed by the government at any time or b) clogging up my storage? What the actual f\*ck. I buy a new PC so I have to tax GiB of data (on top of other GiB that we were getting used to in that bloat OS) and processing power for unwanted features MS uses to collect Big Data??!

Now since I use Linux, I started to consume news about. It also started up my curiousity for desktop computing again somewhat. And that is the other side of the same coin that makes Linux so great! Basically an OS for and by users. I think that can sum it up. 

Once, there was talk about AI maybe coming to Linux and I was like ""Nooooo!"" and someone else was writing what I felt until people came in and reassured: ""If there is AI, it's for you/us users, it will be good AI"". I really have to learn that updates and advancing can be a good thing without fearing some megacompany trying to find a new way of screwing us over. I read about Thorvald's attitude towards even the slightest ""bad direction change"" or contribution to his ""baby"" which is fantastic!

1ne3kc4,Tech,linux,"Window tiling managers mainstream adoption, CachyOS Hyprland Hello,

Due to the hype arround window tiling managers, specifically Hyprland of late, I tried it to get a sense of where the state of their development is and how they compare to mainstream desktop environment like KDE in terms of usability.

Why window tiling managers instead of normal desktop environments?

1. Aesthetics. This is subjective but objectively Linux as a whole lacks an identifying look that make people think at a glance ""Yep, that'd be Linux"" unlike Windows and MacOS where the GUI is easily recognized.
2. Resource usage. Window tiling managers could potentially lower RAM usage for PCs and laptops, especially when not running resource hungry applications. While anecdotal, there were posts on this sub and related subs of users finding that even just moving the mouse cursor on the most used desktop environments, especially above panels, task bars, open windows menus, etc. can sharply increase CPU usage and why at least empirically you could justify the existence and use of a window tiling manager since at the limit it could make under powered systems that lag on normal DEs, work fine with a  window tiling manager, again due to theoretical lower use of RAM and even CPU when the system is just sitting on the desktop and trying to open programs.
3. Workflow, subjective. Many using window tiling managers claim they can better optimize for their workflow to manipulate, open, close tiles than using a desktop environment. I would say this is debatable as Alt Tab or keyboard shortcuts already exist to switch between workspaces with mainstream DE it is in the end a different way of arranging ""windows"" so it could hold true for some people.

Now, with that out of the way, what are the cons?

1. Lack of basic setup from the start. Most window tiling managers when manually installed feel like incomplete desktop environments that the user is forced to build up to do basic tasks. Objectively some may claim it is a pro and not a con and it might be true for them but it is niche and not a mainstream way where things need to be dumbed down, there needs to be plenty of hand holding and explain to the users the features and how to change them as if they are 5 year olds. One should understand that most people, most places at most times are casual users and not even intermediate and they never climb the skill ladder to get there and that's fine. So, for most people having a window tiling manager not set up to a state where it's ready to use, nay to the level of desktop environments that can be used as is without changes and have all the functionality is unacceptable and a roadblock to mainstream adoption.
2. Lack of built in GUI tools to customize the ""panel"". I am using again CachyOS's install of Hyprland but it applies to others to some degree like Manjaro i3 install (though credit to them they have the basic keyboard bindings written on the default wallpaper). But wait, you just said window tiling managers are extremely customizable and this can even be considered a pro by those who use them exclusively? Yes, but not when customizing them require editing .conf files with command line commands. Do you need an example other than say how KDE's panel or settings window allows users to set up the GUI? What? Am I being mean? Well, that is the level of easy and accessible customization for window tiling managers should they be pushed to enter the mainstream.
3. Over indulgence or even malicious intent to exclude the mouse from everything to the extreme in an effort to make it vestigial. While keyboard bidnings are faster in some instances to launch applications, is it faster to open the terminal and use mkdir than fukin idk, right click on the desktop or inside a folder and create said file with another left click? What about changing settings, can you do it faster than a mouse, suppose there was a GUI settings window like desktop environments offer? I am sure there are more examples like closing a specific tile within a cluster with a mouse click instead of cycling ""in focus"" tile with a keyboard combination.

In my testing I found several commonly used and a few niche uses that were either not available or not immediately obvious how to accomplish with Hyprland implementation on CachyOS.

\- Alt Tab between tiles and opened apps

\- Superkey D or show desktop

\- how to launch applications, install or uninstall packages, a GUI package manager in general as most mainstream desktop environments provide as default;

\- if forced to launch firefox or internet browser from terminal tile, how to make either tile full screen, I tried F11 and the warning at the top that says some configs are not set up covered up the top of the browser and said warning tile above the top ""panel"" can't be closed in any obvious way

\- using Print Screen key on the keybaord does seem to do something but it does not show where the image is saved, offers no option for the location, for the file type (png, etc.) or indeed it does not confirm image file.

\- no file manager installed by default that I could find, the fast fetch command output at least showed none.

\- unrelated to Hyprland and more of a CachyOS issue I could not edit GRUB to either remove the timeout or add other linux cmd line variables like ""quiet loglevel=0"" which I usually use to hide the splash screen making thusly both take 5s at least longer to boot and not being able to use sudo update-grub.

In conclusion CachyOS to their credit offer Hyprland in a semi usable state but it needs more changes to become \*the\* desktop environment replacement and elevate it to the aesthetic of Linux machines.

Also after the first restart I was greeted by a window (tile?) informing me that Hyprland has been updated and in the lower part I had 3 button options to Donate, Hide this window at startup or something and last button a big ""Thanks"". I shit you not the only way to close it was to click on thanks as the other option opened another smaller window with only an OK botton for it and after pressing it did not close the first window.

ndlwght,Tech,linux,"nan With all due respect, you dont even know how to use the terminal to install packages and you are writing a review on tiling window managers, of which you just used 1?

TWMs are minimal environments. They are meant to be customized and built up from the user, to cater to the specific users needs.

Con1: That is exactly their purpose. To be a minimal environment which you can build up to YOUR needs. A casual user shouldnt even be thinking about twms. For the reason people shouldnt be using kali as their main os. Because they are specialized tools that fulfill specific needs and cater to a specific audience. 

Con2: Same reason as con1. Twms are minimal environments. If you need gui for whatever reason install it or write one if one does not already exist. If you find it hard or inconvenient to customize stuff through terminal and config files, then they are not meant for you. It is absolutely fine to go back to ubuntu/mint/kubuntu/whatever, but dont try to change things you absolutely do not understand.

Con3: There is no malicious intent to exclude the mouse. What drugs are you on? For most of us it is just easier/faster/muscle memory to do it with keybinds and thats all. Even when there is not an X icon to close an app inside a twm, every app has an exit option in its bar. Again, if you find it so hard to press mod+q or alt+f4 or w/e to close a terminal (only case where there is no X icon natively in my case) then twms are not for you. Stop trying to change things that are not meant for you.

mod+arrows to switch between windows or enable ""focus follows mouse"" from your config.  
mod+number to switch between panels  
Full screen firefox or any app? Read your configs. mod+f in i3. alt+enter for games.  
Superkey+D for show desktop? What desktop?  
Printscreen: There are 2 magical folders called /home/username and /home/username/images. Now, where would an image be automatically saved. hmmm. Plus, again, thats the whole point of a twm. You can customize any aspect of it. Dont like the default printscreen function? Look inside your twm config, find out where screenshots are declared, see which program it used to snap one and look up its parameters then change that command to your needs.   
No file manager: MINIMAL ENVIRONMENT. There is absolutely no way there is no file manager installed at all. Either gui or terminal one. Look inside your configs.

Overall, you are a linux newbie, cant use the terminal, are intimidated by the lack of gui and you are trying to change things that are not meant for you and that you dont understand. It is ok.

1ndpdvo,Tech,linux,"Introducing ccheck = A Lightweight File Content Checker in Go Hi everyone!

I’ve recently been working on a small project called ccheck, aka \`content checker\`, a simple command-line tool written in Go. Its main purpose is to help developers quickly search through project directories for patterns with or without regex while automatically skipping over unwanted or “blacklisted” directories such as node\_modules or target in Linux.

The tool is designed to be:

* Fast and lightweight – written in pure Go with no external dependencies
* Customizable – you can provide your own regex patterns, file extensions, and root directories

Practical for real-world use – especially handy in larger projects where grepping through everything can be noisy or slow

Right now, the project is at an early stage, and I’d love to get feedback and contributions. Whether it’s adding features, improving performance, or just trying it out and opening issues, any input is welcome.

ndifoiv,Tech,linux,"nan I do music videos with multiple cameras and I have a professional Mixer (Tascam Model 24) for the job to record audio from my mics. I'm using the Cinnamon Desktop on Arch (BTW :) ) and it all works really well. I just recorded a cover of a song today. I recorded like 6 videos (attempts because I kept messing up the parts) and I'm going to go through those here shortly and see what's keep-able and what's not. Hoping to have A video to post on Facebook for a friend here this evening. If not I'll have to do it over again either this evening or tomorrow. 

But anyway, Arch with Cinnamon is working pretty well actually. I like it because it has that Windows feel to it and I can move around rather easily with my left hand (I'm a righty but everything computer wise is to my left so I need to use my left hand mostly for computer stuff). 

But yeah I think that no matter what you're playing, finding what you need to record with in Linux is pretty easy to do I think. If you know what you need to use in order to record yourself, then after you've installed it and set it up you should be good to go.

EDIT: BAH!!! I GOOFED!!!  I had a scene setup twice for the recording I did... I use an add on called Source-Record which allows me to record multiple scenes at the same time. I have 3 separate camera angles and I record all 3 at once. Then I can bring all 3 into kdenlive and I can switch scenes and make 1 video with the 3 scenes. It's pretty neat actually. 

Well, I had one camera being recorded twice. That was my mistake.  I've fixed it and im going to record it again today.

ndg4hsf,Tech,linux,"nan >  Isn't WSL essentially a Linux environment running on top of Windows, 

Not originally. 

NT Kernel was originally a microkernel design.  Microsoft abandoned microkernels after the first NT releases when they realized that micro kernels won't ever be competitive with Unix kernels. So they converted NT kernel to a monolithic. 

However it did retain some of the microkernel-type message features. This is what Apple fanboys nonsensically call a ""hybrid microkernel""

One of the effects of this is that NT kernel is capable of adopting ""multiple personalities"".  It can support NT userland, Win64 userland, and POSIX userland. 

And because of this Microsoft Windows was even, for a short time, a certified Unix operating system under the (older) POSIX standard.  They did this because POSIX compatibility was a requirement for many government contracts.  This got to the point were Microsoft actually incorporated some OpenBSD code into Windows to provide these types of features. 

There was a few variations of this feature, but it ended up becoming SFU, as in ""Windows Services for Unix"".

For WSL1 they adopted a Linux userland personality for the Windows NT kernel.   This way you could run Linux software directly on the NT kernel.

So it really was ""Windows Services for Linux"", as in it was a Windows Service for running Linux software.

However this has a lot of limitations.  Even with native linux software support it was difficult to support everything and didn't have the features necessary for containers. 

MIcrosoft adopted the approach that Linux uses for Linux KVM. KVM turns Linux into a ""Type 1 bare metal hypervisor"". Microsoft did the same thing for NT kernel with their Hyper-V hypervisor. 

So with WSL2 they took the approach of just running a Linux kernel in ""Virtual Machine Platform"" portion of Hyper-V. 

That way Windows now has the ability to support containers and has better compatibility with Linux distributions. 


So, yes, it is actually a Windows Service for providing support for Linux applications. They just happen to use a Linux kernel as part of that service. 

So it is still a valid name.",['linux'],isnt wsl essentially a linux environment running on top of windows not originally nt kernel was originally a microkernel design microsoft abandoned microkernels after the first nt releases when they realized that micro kernels wont ever be competitive with unix kernels so they converted nt kernel to a monolithic however it did retain some of the microkerneltype message features this is what apple fanboys nonsensically call a hybrid microkernel one of the effects of this is that nt kernel is capable of adopting multiple personalities it can support nt userland win userland and posix userland and because of this microsoft windows was even for a short time a certified unix operating system under the older posix standard they did this because posix compatibility was a requirement for many government contracts this got to the point were microsoft actually incorporated some openbsd code into windows to provide these types of features there was a few variations of this feature but it ended up becoming sfu as in windows services for unix for wsl they adopted a linux userland personality for the windows nt kernel this way you could run linux software directly on the nt kernel so it really was windows services for linux as in it was a windows service for running linux software however this has a lot of limitations even with native linux software support it was difficult to support everything and didnt have the features necessary for containers microsoft adopted the approach that linux uses for linux kvm kvm turns linux into a type bare metal hypervisor microsoft did the same thing for nt kernel with their hyperv hypervisor so with wsl they took the approach of just running a linux kernel in virtual machine platform portion of hyperv that way windows now has the ability to support containers and has better compatibility with linux distributions so yes it is actually a windows service for providing support for linux applications they just happen to use a linux kernel as part of that service so it is still a valid name,positive

Much like a hard drive, everything stored on it is stored in a particular ""place"" and you need the ""address"" for that place in order for a program to be able to access a particular ""place"" in memory and retrieve data.  Otherwise, your OS would need to constantly scan through all of the addresses searching for data anytime it needed to retrieve a particular piece of data.  So most OSes maintain a ""table"" of addresses, like a sort of spreadsheet or relational database that matches data addresses with an ID for that address, the ID of the program/process that created them, and some other characteristics.  Imagine your kernel is the manager of a storage unit place, and your program is renting lots in the storage unit to store its ""stuff"".

What can happen is that a program or process creates an address in memory to store some data, let's call that address ""A"", it puts it at the very first available address in memory and doesn't ""reserve"" any other addresses or places in memory for that process, just the one chunk - it rents one storage unit and begins throwing its stuff in.  Then, another program asks the OS for a spot in memory, and the OS gives it address ""B"", right next to address ""A"".  Then, your first program realizes it actually needs a few more bytes to store things and asks the OS for more memory, and the OS gives it a third address, ""C"", to store its extra stuff.  So now, that first program is using two separate addresses, at two separate locations in memory, and either it or the kernel is needing to do double work almost every time it reads/writes memory - two lookups, two queries, two write operations, etc.  It would be like having two lots at the storage unit for your stuff, and not exactly knowing what's in each lot every time you need to go grab something, and having to go to the storage unit manager and ask for both keys.  Now, imagine you have something that's slightly bigger than either individual lot, and the storage unit manager is like ""too bad, you'll need to rent one of our larger units for that particular thing, you should've rented a larger unit to begin with"" - the kernel will gladly reserve another place in memory that's just big enough for whatever the program needs to store.  Before long, though, programs might no longer need as much data, and you might have reserved/rented storage units sitting empty, as more programs request more space for more data, and before long, you might end up in a situation where the kernel is looking for space in memory and everything's reserved, and it has to start asking programs to give back their units.

That's a bit of a simplification of memory management, but basically it boils down to:  your RAM is a limited resource that needs to be accessed very quickly in order to take advantage of those precious DDR5 speeds and make things run smoothly.  If your OS manages it haphazardly, you can end up wasting limited space, scattering things out in unorganized blocks that slow down access, or even creating ""leaks"" where things are spilling out of the storage units and anyone with or without an address can just grab things (a huge security concern!)

It looks like the linux kernel is optimizing the way it plays Storage Unit Manager.  Now, RAM is not only faster, but overall space is more affordable and it's not uncommon for home computers to have 16GB+ of the stuff, so space isn't usually quite as precious, so our storage unit manager can afford to look at a new tenant who's requesting one unit and say ""How about I give you two or three units that are all bundled together, and you can store multiple ""sheaths"" of data in one ""barn"" (group of addresses in memory that are all located right next to each other and can be read from or written to in a more efficient manner).  Additionally, because the RAM is so fast now, the OS can move things between these ""storage units"" very quickly, so if a barn needs to be bigger and it's right next to another barn, it can just shuffle things around to resize those ""barns"" and keep all of these groups of things together, for optimal access.  In the storage unit manager's records book, instead of there just being one type of unit (an address), there are now two types of units that nest together:  ""sheaths"" which are specific piles of stuff in ""barns"".  Instead of getting a unit and just throwing everything in the unit, you now have organized piles within the units - your kitchenware and your furniture and your clothes can all be in barn ""A"" and you can specifically send someone (a process) to look through ""Barn A, Sheath B"" when you need your kitchenware instead of going ""Uh, go get my Microwave from Address A, it's in there with the couches and tables and sweaters and other stuff *somewhere*""

Random registry & cmd shenenigans ARE easier and more stable for most use cases then actually understanding Linux internals. Am I missing something? Sorry if I'm repeating known stuff

I was this guy who could do ""format C:"", recovery, reinstalation, and such on friends PC's back in school days.  Not aflex whatsoever - no real skills in IT, just enough wit to solve some basic problems with regular Windows PC's without need to constantly look up terrible help pages.

1. ""Window's help is practically non-existant"" if you say this, then why would the switching to linux movement be surprising? If you want control, Linux gives you that control without hiding anything. That only really matters for power users, but power users are the only group that cares about this in the first place.

2. For the regular person who only uses their PC to access the web or touch up some documents, Linux is no different from Windows. There is no ""learning a new OS"" here, the interfaces are the same and these non-tech-savvy couldn't tell the difference between windows and Linux. So for this group of people, there isn't even any argument to be made, they don't know any better about what OS they use, and for their use cases they don't need to.

I don't really get what you mean in the last paragraph. Any OS gives you a set of utilities you don't inherently understand, heck I study computer science and theres still so many things I don't know. That doesn't change when switching to Linux, if anything it should be easier to understand how Linux works due to it not hiding things from the user. 

And if you want to hear about something that made windows unusable, I can tell why I switched a year ago. I had many reasons, but one of the most annoying things on windows were the various services running in the background whenever I was gaming. Said services had a habit of bugging out and eating up all my CPU usage, meaning at any moment when I'm gaming I could start lagging to unplayable levels. This happened commonly enough that gaming on Linux, for me, is just more stable. Sure you could say I could disable these services, but some of them were not clear on what they do.

ndcma7a,Tech,linux,"nan I wrote a long comment, about on how many levels you are wrong, but reading your responses to the other comments I noticed something.

You just don't understand neither Linux nor Windows. And don't want to understand. So let me tell you this:

If you're roughly the same age as me (mid 90s kid), and if your nick is anything to go by, we both grew up in Poland in the same times. This means, you spent most of your childhood ACTUALLY LEARNING how to use Windows. That's why you understand and can use it. Not because Windows is so easy and doesn't require learning. You just learned it and forgot about the fact that you learned it.

And yes, switching to new OS will require this learning as well. Difference being, we're in the age of the Internet, and as you yourself pointed out - there are MOUNTAINS of resources on Linux and how to use and fix it. So this learning step can be speedrun pretty much in the span of a month I guess?

And the best part is - modern Linux is about as hard to learn as Android. With how everything now has GUI, you use Software Center to install apps, just like you'd do with Play Store, and if your goal is to use your computer for watching funny videos on the Internet and play games, you don't have to open the terminal once. And if you need to open it - well, there are hundreds of thousands of people, that are just waiting in line to help you, share their knowledge and experience. And their advises will not be to ""restart, and if this doesn't fix the problem, reinstall the system"".

What I find funny, 90% of people that claim they ""tried"" Linux, just installed it, poked around, changed some settings, pasted some random commands from the Internet and broke their system, then just got back to Windows, not using Linux for even a day. It's like you got in the Lambo, clicked some buttons, started it, clutch-dumped, the engine stalled, so you got out and decided, that Lambo is shit, and your Seicento is way better.

ndchjny,Tech,linux,"nan In my opinion it should be a ""Use the OS right for you"" rather than ""You must use linux""

For many people linux can definitely be the better choice, for example developers. Still there are some that prefer windows or mac.

For gamers linux isn't great because of the anti cheat support **but** windows also isn't great for them either... there is a whole market of people ""boosting FPS"" and improving the performance of the windows systems which for the most part is setting power options and removing bloat... that linux wouldn't include, so theoretically if the anti cheat issue got solved I'd argue linux would be better for gamers.

As for the average andy that browses the web and whatnot I'd say there is a strong value proposition about privacy, the current direction windows is heading is... interesting to say the least. Why worry about cortana or recall or copilot or all the telemetry and disabling all of it when you could just have a system that is yours and doesn't include the things you don't want?

And I think that comes down to the main point, ownership. Sure you own your windows machine but its more like renting a house, you can't really take down a wall if you wanted to or sometimes even nail something to that wall. Where linux is like owning a house, you don't like the wall? get rid of it, fuck it blow it all to hell if that's what you want to do, its yours.

And as an additional thing I'd say linux is far easier and more comfortable to fix if something goes wrong (once you understand it of course, if someone never touched a computer they obviously wouldn't be able to troubleshoot either system).

ndey0ti,Tech,linux,"nan Here’s a different take from someone that started computing with MS-DOS and used windows until the end of 7. 

Continuing to use windows would have been a gigantic waste of my time. Constantly keeping up with stripping the latest „features“ from the OS, just to see  them reinstalled with the next update was exhausting (even if it may be fun for some). 

The UI is getting worse and worse with every iteration. As you point out yourself, windows help or troubleshooting error 0x000fb, which can have 5 completely unrelated causes, is next to impossible.

Heck, even ChatGPT can solve a lot of issues, but I’d take this with a grain of salt. 

Contrary to windows, the Linux knowledge isn’t wasted.

1ncqyvg,Tech,linux,"Wayland is just too barebones for me to use When I was a Linux beginner Wayland was this weird thing that everyone thought might have been the future, but was really unfinished and incompatible, and it was nothing more than an optional addition. Now more and more distros and desktop environments are replacing X11 with Wayland as we speak.

I am not going to switch to Wayland, and I have valid reasons for that. It just makes me upset that X11 is being so  pushed out.

For people claiming that Wayland is perfect: it is not. It is worse than X11.

The problem is the Wayland architecture itself.

X is build around the concept of a server and clients connected to that server. The thing actually handling the desktop is not the desktop environment itself.

And this allows for the cool features X has, namely:

* WM hot-replacing (try running ""openbox --replace"", and openbox will replace whatever WM you're currently running).
* The basic tools for managing desktop-related stuff are not WM-dependent.
* It is much easier to write an X11 window manager than a wayland compositor, since all the basics are already here and instead of copy-pasting the required garbage like you were a Windows programmer trying to create a window with WinAPI you can focus on doing the actual work.

There are surely more examples, but these are the ones that are on my head right now.

The most important from my point of view is the second. WM-independent desktop programs are awesome.

For example, I often need to switch keyboard layouts on the fly.

In X11 I just have an entry in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols, and I use the 'setxkbmap' command to set the layout I want.

A lot of you will probably yell at me, saying that this is not how I should be doing it, but you know what? I don't care. It works and I've had zero problems with it through the many years I've been using it.

In wayland there is no universal solution for that. Big desktops like KDE and GNOME have their own graphical menus (I don't like graphical menus for switching keyboards; it's much easier to hit the up-arrow key on the terminal and press enter). Sway requires you to change the config file and restart the desktop, which is very inconvenient when I want to change the keyboard layout several times a minute.

Plus, I don't know what on earth is the format those wayland compositors are using for that. Probably every wayland desktop uses its own thing, so screw portability.

  
Next, there is xrandr. It's basically a tool that lets you change your screen resolution from the commandline. It's mostly used to change the screen resolution, which isn't as much of an issue as it was twenty years ago, but it's still usable on virtual machines and stuff.

Wayland doesn't have xrandr or any similar tool. Everything is desktop specific, so once again, screw portability.

  
At last, there is xkill. When a program hangs you can just run xkill, then select the window you want gone, and it kills the process.

For most hung processes I use 'kill -9 $(pidof <program>)', but xkill is incredibly useful for killing broken wine applications, since the program name of a wine application is the literal Windows path of its .exe executable, and typing it would be tedious.

On wayland, once again, there is no such a thing. Some desktops might have a similar functionality, some don't, so for the third time: screw portability.

  
I don't want the tools I use to be dependent on one specific desktop. I use many desktops. I use MATE a lot, I use Unity on an old Ubuntu setup, I use WindowMaker, and now I am writing this from i3 on Slackware 15.

With X11 I can use the same tools on all of them. Wayland can't do that. By design.



Another thing is xwayland, which is part of the problem. Running one windowing system inside of another means consistency issues.

When I was trying out wayland I noticed that xwayland applications (and there were many of them) lacked the correct theme, and there were also other issues.

On X11 there is no problem, since all applications are running under the same windowing system, utilizing the same API.

  
One more thing are the drivers. X11 is modular, so it's simply the matter of installing the xf86-video-<graphics card> of xf86-input-<an obscure input device> package.

On wayland ... I am no engineer, but for me it looks like the Wild West, and even though I have been using Linux as my only operating system for years and have been tinkering with it a lot, I have absolutely no idea how to install a driver in wayland and there is barely any information about it. The Arch Wiki said that it's all about KMS, which I suspect means that all the drivers are baked into the kernel and I guess you have to recompile it when adding unsupported hardware (correct me if I'm wrong).



Moreover, for me there are no real benefits of using wayland.

Does it make the system more performant? From my experience no, it doesn't. And even if it did, the difference is too small to be meaningful.

Does it make the system more usable? No, actually it's quite the opposite.

The reason, as always, is security. For security Apple glues hard drives to the motherboard so that you cannot replace them. Also for security they put the BIOS partly on the hard drive, so when it dies you have to buy a new computer. For security they are forcing ID verification on sites that have nothing to do with you all know what. For security they are making everyone switch to an objectively worse environment that has no real benefits for the majority of its userbase, and even has downsides in certain scenarios.

Is a change really needed? No, I don't think so.

X11 has worked for forty years, and while yes, there were some issues with the early 2000s, all of Linux had those issues, not only X11, but anyway they are no longer here.

X11 has since at least 2012 been providing a good user experience. Before there were problems, yes (I was recently trying to install Mandriva 2007, and it was not a good experience), but now they are no longer here. X11 just works.

  
So that are the reasons why I am never going to use wayland.

Honestly I don't care about XLibre. All those new features stalled in Xorg for years are not something I would make use of or notice anyway.

The X11 in Ubuntu 12.04 from 13 years ago provides exactly the same experience as the X11 in Slackware 15 or Devuan 4.

Is that a bad thing? Not by any means. Contrary to what people believe, updates are not something that is necessary. You absolutely can use older distros, with the only thing actually needing to be updated being the web browser (that is not its fault; rather that the internet is becoming more and more bloated at an incredible pace).

Basically from my point of view trying to push Wayland everywhere is like Tim Cook trying to persuade you that you have to buy an iPhone, despite there being nothing wrong with your current phone, and despite that iPhone being worse than your phone.

Because your phone is outdated, and so is X11.

And I am fine with it!

Software like DOSBOX or LXAppearance haven't received any significant updates in the last decade, maybe longer, and this doesn't make them bad software. I love DosBox and I love lxappearance, and I don't want anyone to force me to abandon them just because they are ""outdated"".

ndbnv2g,Tech,linux,"nan I see that in the comments you keep complaining about people downvoting you without explaining, so let me try to explain.

What annoys me about these types of posts that complain about Wayland, is that it is filled with inaccuracies and misinformation. There are legitimate reasons to criticize Wayland, but when I see reasons that are just plain wrong, it makes the rest of the argument not really worth considering. Let me try to demonstrate:

>When I was trying out wayland I noticed that xwayland applications (and there were many of them) lacked the correct theme, and there were also other issues.

>On X11 there is no problem, since all applications are running under the same windowing system, utilizing the same API.

This is just outright misleading and false. XWayland was developed to provide compatibility for apps that only work on X11. You're right that they lack the correct theme and it even has other issues like apps being blurry. However, that's the fault of the app. If the app supported Wayland, it would work fine, but the fact that the app can even run on a Wayland only session is something very positive in Wayland's favor. The opposite isn't true. Wayland only apps can't be run by X11. So I guess yes, all your apps will have the same theme because anything that doesn't explicitly support X11 simply won't be able to run.

Now I'm going to be honest and just say that I don't have enough knowledge to verify what you claim in your post, but when you make such a blatantly false claim about XWayland, it makes it hard to take the rest of your post seriously. Probably, the biggest issue that you have is simply that not all of your favorite tools support Wayland, but it is highly misleading to blame Wayland for what is essentially an app issue. The fact that I have to run Zoom on XWayland instead of Wayland is something that I blame Zoom for, not Wayland.

>Is a change really needed? No, I don't think so.

This is ultimately why people who keep complaining about Wayland are often dismissed. Whenever anyone tries to attack Wayland, they ignore the massive gaping issues with X11. You've just lived with these massive problems for so long that you're so used to it that it became completely normal for you, but for a modern computing experience, it's simply unacceptable. For example:

* It's not good that X11 can't do even the most basic fractional scaling without becoming a blurry mess.
* It's not good that X11 can't support different resolutions on different monitors.
* It's not good that X11 turns every single app on your computer into a keylogger
* It's not good that X11 allows every to see what's in every window and every monitor
* It's not good that X11's own developers could barely work on its code and it required such an in-depth knowledge that no one could realistically replace any of the core developers in any meaningful capacity

The fact that you won't even admit that these flaws exist in X11, and the fact that you won't even recognize incredible strides that Wayland has made in addressing every one of these issues (e.g. adding HDR, more advanced color management, etc.) **while still being able to run X11 only apps** is very telling that you're not interested in actually exploring the nuances of the problem. You just hate Wayland and you will find any reason (justified or not) to say how bad it is.

It's the same for people who hate Systemd, or Flatpaks, or atomic distros, or Rust, or anything new that changes something in Linux. All of these are imperfect solutions that can be criticized and improved. But so much of the criticism comes not from a genuine place of hoping for it to get better, but from a place of hating anything new that changes the things that they're comfortable with. And if that's the place you're coming from, then most people don't have the time or interest in engaging with that.

edit: grammar & spelling",['linux'],i see that in the comments you keep complaining about people downvoting you without explaining so let me try to explain what annoys me about these types of posts that complain about wayland is that it is filled with inaccuracies and misinformation there are legitimate reasons to criticize wayland but when i see reasons that are just plain wrong it makes the rest of the argument not really worth considering let me try to demonstrate when i was trying out wayland i noticed that xwayland applications and there were many of them lacked the correct theme and there were also other issues on x there is no problem since all applications are running under the same windowing system utilizing the same api this is just outright misleading and false xwayland was developed to provide compatibility for apps that only work on x youre right that they lack the correct theme and it even has other issues like apps being blurry however thats the fault of the app if the app supported wayland it would work fine but the fact that the app can even run on a wayland only session is something very positive in waylands favor the opposite isnt true wayland only apps cant be run by x so i guess yes all your apps will have the same theme because anything that doesnt explicitly support x simply wont be able to run now im going to be honest and just say that i dont have enough knowledge to verify what you claim in your post but when you make such a blatantly false claim about xwayland it makes it hard to take the rest of your post seriously probably the biggest issue that you have is simply that not all of your favorite tools support wayland but it is highly misleading to blame wayland for what is essentially an app issue the fact that i have to run zoom on xwayland instead of wayland is something that i blame zoom for not wayland is a change really needed no i dont think so this is ultimately why people who keep complaining about wayland are often dismissed whenever anyone tries to attack wayland they ignore the massive gaping issues with x youve just lived with these massive problems for so long that youre so used to it that it became completely normal for you but for a modern computing experience its simply unacceptable for example its not good that x cant do even the most basic fractional scaling without becoming a blurry mess its not good that x cant support different resolutions on different monitors its not good that x turns every single app on your computer into a keylogger its not good that x allows every to see whats in every window and every monitor its not good that xs own developers could barely work on its code and it required such an indepth knowledge that no one could realistically replace any of the core developers in any meaningful capacity the fact that you wont even admit that these flaws exist in x and the fact that you wont even recognize incredible strides that wayland has made in addressing every one of these issues eg adding hdr more advanced color management etc while still being able to run x only apps is very telling that youre not interested in actually exploring the nuances of the problem you just hate wayland and you will find any reason justified or not to say how bad it is its the same for people who hate systemd or flatpaks or atomic distros or rust or anything new that changes something in linux all of these are imperfect solutions that can be criticized and improved but so much of the criticism comes not from a genuine place of hoping for it to get better but from a place of hating anything new that changes the things that theyre comfortable with and if thats the place youre coming from then most people dont have the time or interest in engaging with that edit grammar spelling,negative
ndbk6pt,Tech,linux,"nan My biggest problem with Linux desktop has always been the piss poor handling of everything related to video display.

The horrible screen-tearing, inconsistent rendering and lack of anything even resembling smooth video playback. Extremely poor performance overall.

Dicking around with compositor settings is not something I want to waste my time on. I don't like swapping back and forth depending on whether I'm going to watch a video on YouTube or type something up.

Wayland took care of all these problems for me, I get some glitchy text or menus from time to time but that's not a huge deal for me.

nddbkyl,Tech,linux,"nan Ultimately theming is a support issue, and as you even mentioned with OBS, sometimes the best solution is to restrict it to reduce the support burden. This is especially true with open source projects that are already strapped for time and money. GNOME prides themselves on lack of theming and heavily using libadwaita because they don't want extra engineering overhead.

In a way, because of theming and the bugs generated from it, has caused devs to remove or restrict it heavily. It would be one thing if users understood that theming is on them and any bugs related to it should not be filed with the upstream project. But that's really more of a community and cultural issue to deal with.

Many of the theming hooks put into apps and toolkits were never really meant for end-users, but system integrators. (Qt is one such example. Yes, it's great at theming, but end users being able to theme it is more of a byproduct than the intended use case.)

Most people use the defaults. Heavily theming is a very niche thing, much akin to other ""craft"" hobbies.

I agree sometimes theming can help with accessibility. But in those cases wouldn't it be more useful to bring the accessibility concerns up to the DE devs and assist them so they can work on system-wide solutions?

Otherwise a lot of it reads like developers should have a heavier workload so that apps can be highly themed, which the vast majority of their users won't use.

ndc61dm,Tech,linux,"nan You keep bringing up points and then end up pointing out why they suck a few sentences later. Your whole article was written with the assumption that a ""unified theme customization"" is something DEs and developers prioritize or that all linux users are browsing r/unixporn every day to find a perfect setup they never end up using for anything other than a screenshot. They don't.

You also wrote this around a handful of toolkits that, even though they are the majority on linux, are not the only ones you'll come across. Say every linux dev wakes up tomorrow and decides to work together on a single theming solution. What happens when you open a Flutter app then? Nothing, it will keep using it's custom renderer with material styles or anything else the developers used, same for the other hundreds of toolkits out there, imgui, webview-based apps, iced (not libcosmic), Freya, slint etc.

You said it yourself, theming can break apps in all toolkits. That's because toolkits are not centered around the end user but the developers using them. The developer has the final say in how their apps look and are designed in all platforms, including the web. You wouldn't expect a single stylesheet to work universally on all websites, would you?

Developers are the ones allowing you to do whatever theming you can even do right now in the first place. This is a Qt app with a custom theme on linux to resemble Windows' fluent UI https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/1mhcuys/koncentro_a_productivity_app_with_a_pomodoro/ it's not themeable by the user. OBS disabled following system themes after dealing with one too many bugs on linux https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/10715#issuecomment-2127888300.

You bring up GNOME Text Editor and Discord but there's a difference with these. They control their theming by default. They know exactly how to theme themselves and their themes follow changes in the codebase and layout. Your Discord however, uses a custom theme outside those offered by Discord themselves and you can see how terrible it is, the link in ""For more info, see #known-issues"" and the name below it are barely visible. That's the same problem Gradience had. Every time libadwaita added a new widget (like the sidebar) and a new color was introduced, Gradience had to catch up and update all themes otherwise it looked broken. Your ideal 'theming standard' will also have this problem, you are asking toolkits to never add anything else ever again or somehow organize all toolkits and themes to add new colors (and leave apps half-themed while themes update) every time ANY of the toolkits need a new one.

In another comment you brought up material you but failed to mention that it only works... with material and if developers opt-in. Firefox, Revolut and the majority of apps won't follow it, Google Play uses the default blue accent, Android skins and their default apps use their own styles.

1nc40h2,Tech,linux,"Why Linux has a scattered file system: a deep dive I've seen a lot of Windows users who have given Linux a shot be confused, annoyed or generally critical of the fact that Windows has a scattered file system where a package will generally install stuff ""all over the place"" instead of in a simple neat directory. Ideally, programs install their static files: .exe's, .dll's and resources; in `C:\Program Files` , user files in `%APPDATA%` and some small global config in the registry. It's a little more complicated in practice, but that's generally the gist of it. This system does have some advantages. It makes it really easy for a particular program to be installed on a different drive for example. So it does make sense why Windows users would be taken aback by the scattered file system of Linux, where programs have files seemingly all over the place.

And so I wanted to make this post to outline what all of the directories in the Linux file system are, why they exist, and what advantages this design has over ""one program <-> one package"" design. It should hopefully also serve as an overview for new Linux users looking to learn more about their system. At least, it will be a post I can link to others if I ever need it.

**Chapter I -- what's in** `/`

**Chapter Ia -- system file directories**

These are directories where system files live.

In the traditional Linux view, the ""system"" basically means ""your package manager"". So this includes the core system components and programs installed through your package manager (be it apt on Debian/Ubuntu, dnf on RHEL/Fedora or pacman on Arch). There is no difference real between ""system files"" and ""program files"" on Linux when the programs are installed as packages. The ""base"" system, the one you get right after install, is just a bunch of packages, with many ""spins"" (Fedora KDE, Xubuntu etc.) basically being just different sets of packages to install as base.

Users do not generally do not write files here, but they read or execute them all the time -- programs, fonts, etc.

The directories are:

* `/usr` \-- static files (binaries, libraries, resources, fonts, etc.)
* `/var` \-- dynamic files (logs, databases, etc.)
* `/etc` \-- configuration files
* `/boot` \-- boot files

The reason these are all different directories? Well, you might want to put each of them on different partitions, or only some of them, or have all of them on the same partition, depending on your use case.

For example, you may want to mount `/usr` and/or `/etc` as read only after configuring your system to harden it. You may want to share `/etc` around multiple systems that should be configured identically. You may want to only backup `/etc` and `/var` since `/usr` and `/boot` can be easily recreated by the package manager.

These are not only theoretical use cases. The desktop distro I use is a version of Fedora Immutable, in which `/usr` is mounted as read-only, `/var` is mounted as read-write and `/etc` is mounted as an overlay filesystem, allowing me to modify it, but also allowing me to view what changes I made to system configuration and easily revert if needed.

`/boot` is kept separate because it sometimes needs to be separate, but not always. A use case for this (not the only one) is what I use: most of my disk is encrypted, so `/boot` is a separate, unencrypted partition, so the kernel can launch from there and decrypt the rest of my disk after asking me for the password.

**Chapter Ib -- user file directories**

These are the directories where users can store files and the package manager will not touch (but other system utilities may touch).

These directories are:

* `/home` \-- the home directories of users
* `/root` \-- the home directory of the root user (the administrator account)
* `/srv` \-- files to be served

These are pretty self-explanatory. `/root` is not a sub-directory of home because it's actually more something between a system directory and a user directory. Package managers will sometimes touch it.

Moreover, if you have a bunch of Linux servers that share user lists and have `/home` mounted on the network (allowing the user to log into any server and see their files), the `/root` home should still be per-server.

`/srv` is just a convenient place to store files, such as those shared via FTP, HTTP, or any other files you need to store that is not just ""a user's files"". It's entirely unstructured. No tools that I know of create directories here without being told to, so it's a nice place to just put stuff on a server. Not very useful on a desktop.

**Chapter Ic -- temporary mount points**

These are mostly empty directories (or directories of empty directories) made for mounting partitions, removable drives, .ios's etc. that would not make sense anywhere else in a filesystem -- usually temporarily

These directories are:

* `/mnt` \-- for manual mounting
* `/media` \-- for automatic mounting of removable media

You generally do not need to worry about `/mnt` unless you are doing some command line work. Same for `/media`, if you just insert a USB stick, it'll be mounted here, but you'll also get a GUI icon to click on that will take you here, you don't generally have to manually navigate here.

**Chapter Id -- virtual file systems**

These are directories who's contents don't ""actually exist"" (on disk). One of Linux's great strengths, especially from a developer perspective, is that everything is a file, be it a real one on disk, or a virtual one. Programs that can write to a file, can also write to virtual files, be they disks, terminal windows or device control files.

These directories are:

* `/run` and `/tmp` \-- temporary files stored in RAM
* `/proc` and `/sys` \-- low level process and system information respectively
* `/dev` \-- device files

Now, you can safely ignore `/proc` and `/sys` as a regular user. When you open the GUI ~~Task Manager~~ System Monitor, the GUI System Monitor will read from these places, but you don't need to do so manually.

The `/run` and `/tmp` files are in-RAM places for temporary files. The reason there are two is historical and I won't go into it.

`/dev` is where all of the devices are represented. You will be exposed to this when you, for example, flash a USB stick, and the flashing utility will allow you to select `/dev/sdb` (SATA drive B) to flash to. Hopefully, you will also get a user-friendly name (""Kingston DataTraveller 32GB) next to it.

**Chapter Ie -- the** `/opt` **directory**

There are some cases where programs do want to be installed in a Program Files manner with a huge directory of stuff. This is either stuff that was lazily ported, or stuff with a lot of data (100GB Vivado installs). 

This is what the `/opt` directory is for.

The package manager will generally not touch it, but graphical installers of proprietary software may default to this place.

In the case of large installs, it also makes it easier to put some of the sub-directories of `/opt`, or the entire thing, on a separate drive/partition. It also allows large installs to be networked mounted, in the case of many small computers using proprietary software from a local NFS server.

**Chapter II -- the structure of** `/usr`

**Chapter IIa -- the useful sub-directories of** `/usr` **that will always be there**

These directories are:

* `/usr/bin` \-- executable meant to be run by users
* `/usr/lib` \-- shared libraries (dll's) (see bellow)
* `/usr/share` \-- non-executable resource files

The reason libraries are all together is that each binary is generally dynamically linked, so if the same library is used by 10 different executables, it exists only once in the system.

The reason binaries are all together is so that the shell can search in one place for all of them.

**Chapter IIb -- the less useful or situational sub-directories of** `/usr` **that will usually always be there**

These directories are:

* `/usr/src` \-- sources for packages on the system, generally installed by special `*-src` packages, usually empty or almost empty
* `/usr/include` \-- stuff for C programming. Should arguably be a sub-directory to `/usr/share`, but hey, C is the big daddy and gets special privileges
* `/usr/games` \-- name is self explanatory. No, this directory is not used today. It's a relic.

**Chapter IIc -- the** `/usr/lib` **debacle**

`/usr/lib` is meant to hold shared libraries (32-bit and 64-bit if multilib is supported) and also ""executable resources"" of packages. The major distros do not agree on where to put each of these things.

On Debian/Ubuntu we have:

* `/usr/lib/<package>` \-- executable resources not meant to be run directly by users
* `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` \-- 64-bit libraries
* `/usr/lib/i686-linunx-gnu` \-- 32-bit libraries

On Red Hat/Fedora we have:

* `/usr/lib` \-- 32-bit libraries
* `/usr/lib64` \-- 64-bit libraries
* `/usr/libexec` \-- executable resources not meant to be run directly by users

On Arch we have:

* `/usr/lib` \-- 64-bit libraries
* `/usr/lib32` \-- 32-bit libraries
* `/usr/libexec` \-- executable resources not meant to be run directly by users

**Chapter IId -- the** `/usr/sbin` **debacle**

`/usr/sbin` is a directory meant for binaries that are not meant to be run by users, but only by administrators and such. It's kind of a relic of the past, and Fedora has moved to replace `/usr/sbin` with a link to `/usr/bin` (it's that way on my system)

**Chapter IIe -- the** `/bin`/`/lib` **debacle**

Back in the olden days, there used to be a difference between the core system that lived on `/` and the fat system that lived on `/usr`. This is a relic of the past. For backwards compatibility, the following links exist:

* `/bin -> /usr/bin`
* `/sbin -> /usr/sbin`
* `/lib -> /usr/lib`
* `/libexec -> /usr/libexec` (on Red Hat/Fedora and Arch)
* `/lib64 -> /usr/lib64` (on Red Hat/Fedora)
* `/lib32 -> /usr/lib32` (on Arch)

**Chapter IIf --** `/usr/local`

A copy of all the directories described above exist under `/usr/local` (eg. `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/local/lib`). This exists for packages that maintain the standard bin, lib, share structure, so would not fit in /opt. but are installed by the admin user manually and not through the package manager.

This is to avoid conflicts and unwanted overwrites. Most source packages (eg. what you find on GitHub) default to installing here after compilation.

**Chapter III -- the structure of** `~`

**Chapter IIIa -- the wild wild** `.west`

Programs need to store per-user data and they will generally do this in the user's home. This is `/home/bob`, `$HOME` or just `~`.

Now, back in the olden days they did this with no real structure. In Linux, directories that start with a dot are ""hidden"", so they would just throw some directory in the home and store everything there: `~/.vim`, `~/.steam`, `~/.ssh`, etc.

**Chapter IIIb -- the XDG directory system**

Recently, an effort has been made to standardize the places programs put user files. This system mirrors the system hierarchy, but uses more modern naming for things.

* `~/.local/share` \-- equivalent to `/usr/share`
* `~/.local/state` \-- partially equivalent to `/var`; for program state
* `~/.local/bin` \-- equivalent to `/usr/bin`
* `~/.config` \-- equivalent to `/etc`
* `~/.cache` \-- partially equivalent to `/var`; for temporary files too big to store in RAM
* `/run/user/<uid>` \-- in RAM temporary files

More details [here](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/).

**Chapter IIIc -- flatpaks**

Flatpaks are containerized desktop apps. Flatpak stores it's data in `~/.var`",['linux'],why linux has a scattered file system a deep dive ive seen a lot of windows users who have given linux a shot be confused annoyed or generally critical of the fact that windows has a scattered file system where a package will generally install stuff all over the place instead of in a simple neat directory ideally programs install their static files exes dlls and resources in cprogram files user files in appdata and some small global config in the registry its a little more complicated in practice but thats generally the gist of it this system does have some advantages it makes it really easy for a particular program to be installed on a different drive for example so it does make sense why windows users would be taken aback by the scattered file system of linux where programs have files seemingly all over the place and so i wanted to make this post to outline what all of the directories in the linux file system are why they exist and what advantages this design has over one program one package design it should hopefully also serve as an overview for new linux users looking to learn more about their system at least it will be a post i can link to others if i ever need it chapter i whats in chapter ia system file directories these are directories where system files live in the traditional linux view the system basically means your package manager so this includes the core system components and programs installed through your package manager be it apt on debianubuntu dnf on rhelfedora or pacman on arch there is no difference real between system files and program files on linux when the programs are installed as packages the base system the one you get right after install is just a bunch of packages with many spins fedora kde xubuntu etc basically being just different sets of packages to install as base users do not generally do not write files here but they read or execute them all the time programs fonts etc the directories are usr static files binaries libraries resources fonts etc var dynamic files logs databases etc etc configuration files boot boot files the reason these are all different directories well you might want to put each of them on different partitions or only some of them or have all of them on the same partition depending on your use case for example you may want to mount usr andor etc as read only after configuring your system to harden it you may want to share etc around multiple systems that should be configured identically you may want to only backup etc and var since usr and boot can be easily recreated by the package manager these are not only theoretical use cases the desktop distro i use is a version of fedora immutable in which usr is mounted as readonly var is mounted as readwrite and etc is mounted as an overlay filesystem allowing me to modify it but also allowing me to view what changes i made to system configuration and easily revert if needed boot is kept separate because it sometimes needs to be separate but not always a use case for this not the only one is what i use most of my disk is encrypted so boot is a separate unencrypted partition so the kernel can launch from there and decrypt the rest of my disk after asking me for the password chapter ib user file directories these are the directories where users can store files and the package manager will not touch but other system utilities may touch these directories are home the home directories of users root the home directory of the root user the administrator account srv files to be served these are pretty selfexplanatory root is not a subdirectory of home because its actually more something between a system directory and a user directory package managers will sometimes touch it moreover if you have a bunch of linux servers that share user lists and have home mounted on the network allowing the user to log into any server and see their files the root home should still be perserver srv is just a convenient place to store files such as those shared via ftp or any other files you need to store that is not just a users files its entirely unstructured no tools that i know of create directories here without being told to so its a nice place to just put stuff on a server not very useful on a desktop chapter ic temporary mount points these are mostly empty directories or directories of empty directories made for mounting partitions removable drives ioss etc that would not make sense anywhere else in a filesystem usually temporarily these directories are mnt for manual mounting media for automatic mounting of removable media you generally do not need to worry about mnt unless you are doing some command line work same for media if you just insert a usb stick itll be mounted here but youll also get a gui icon to click on that will take you here you dont generally have to manually navigate here chapter id virtual file systems these are directories whos contents dont actually exist on disk one of linuxs great strengths especially from a developer perspective is that everything is a file be it a real one on disk or a virtual one programs that can write to a file can also write to virtual files be they disks terminal windows or device control files these directories are run and tmp temporary files stored in ram proc and sys low level process and system information respectively dev device files now you can safely ignore proc and sys as a regular user when you open the gui task manager system monitor the gui system monitor will read from these places but you dont need to do so manually the run and tmp files are inram places for temporary files the reason there are two is historical and i wont go into it dev is where all

nd6hnxo,Tech,linux,"nan Kudos for your effort! I'd imagine that took quite some while to compile and write up.

However the file system hierarchy has already been explained in a much more concise manner elsewhere.

Also, I have to note a bit about the very beginning since there seems to be some confusion about terminology here. *Scattered filesystem* sounds like some kind of problem on how the data is stored on a file system i.e. fragmentation (which is not so much of a problem with SSDs than it used to be with mechanical drives, which have seek times which are all but insignificant). Historically, many filesystems traditionally used on Linux have been better at handling data fragmentation among other things, however I don't have a source to back up that claim.

What you are talking about instead is the folder structure. **The folder structure and a file system have nothing to do with each other**. The distinction between Windows (stemming from DOS) and many other operating systems is that there are no drive letters on the better side of the fence. File systems are ""mounted"" somewhere on the FS hierarchy (yes, it can be arbitrary, but there are conventions). The root filesystem starts at ""/"", and that's the closest you can get to what is equivalent to ""C:"" in Windows. Any ohter mounted drive (another hard drive partition, USB stick, floppy, network drive, optical drive, temporary file system in RAM, virtual file systems etc. etc.) will replace some chosen folder - usually one which has been reserved for this specific task - with the contents of this drive. Nothing prevents nested mounts (and they are not that rare either). 

*The drive letter system is honestly something Windows should have abandoned in the DOS days. There's no need for it, it's limiting the computer, and clunky.*

In Linux (Kernel and GNU userspace tools) there are much more options on where a data in a folder hierarchy actually is. It can be on any mechanical drive, partition, or several of them (LVM, btrfs, zfs and the like) - and can change at any time transparently to the software. There are no drive letters - but in Windows, you are forced to add a drive letter whenever adding a drive (generally). In Linux, you can choose to mount another drive where-ever you wish. Everything is a file - adding space is in principle (and IMHO also in practice) a lot easier to manage. Drive with root filesystem too small? Get a new one, rsync it offline, set up bootloader and presto! Now try to do the same with Windows (Spoiler: You can not. You need third party tools **and a third drive**, or simply give up and re-install).

If you have some kind of a RAID filesystem which can grow in width, just add drives - and you have more space!",['linux'],kudos for your effort id imagine that took quite some while to compile and write up however the file system hierarchy has already been explained in a much more concise manner elsewhere also i have to note a bit about the very beginning since there seems to be some confusion about terminology here scattered filesystem sounds like some kind of problem on how the data is stored on a file system ie fragmentation which is not so much of a problem with ssds than it used to be with mechanical drives which have seek times which are all but insignificant historically many filesystems traditionally used on linux have been better at handling data fragmentation among other things however i dont have a source to back up that claim what you are talking about instead is the folder structure the folder structure and a file system have nothing to do with each other the distinction between windows stemming from dos and many other operating systems is that there are no drive letters on the better side of the fence file systems are mounted somewhere on the fs hierarchy yes it can be arbitrary but there are conventions the root filesystem starts at and thats the closest you can get to what is equivalent to c in windows any ohter mounted drive another hard drive partition usb stick floppy network drive optical drive temporary file system in ram virtual file systems etc etc will replace some chosen folder usually one which has been reserved for this specific task with the contents of this drive nothing prevents nested mounts and they are not that rare either the drive letter system is honestly something windows should have abandoned in the dos days theres no need for it its limiting the computer and clunky in linux kernel and gnu userspace tools there are much more options on where a data in a folder hierarchy actually is it can be on any mechanical drive partition or several of them lvm btrfs zfs and the like and can change at any time transparently to the software there are no drive letters but in windows you are forced to add a drive letter whenever adding a drive generally in linux you can choose to mount another drive whereever you wish everything is a file adding space is in principle and imho also in practice a lot easier to manage drive with root filesystem too small get a new one rsync it offline set up bootloader and presto now try to do the same with windows spoiler you can not you need third party tools and a third drive or simply give up and reinstall if you have some kind of a raid filesystem which can grow in width just add drives and you have more space,positive

nd6ovej,Tech,linux,"nan This is long and generally good, but:

* /home is **not standard**, but a convenience choice for tiny, simple sites.  It does not scale to large sites, where $HOME might look like /nfs/somehostname/diskname/username or be buried in AFS (the Andrew Filesystem) or something else arcane
* Historically /usr had user home directories, but those teams built up too much useful software in directories they shared there like /usr/local, /usr/bin, /usr/lib etc - notably not yet part of the underlying UNIX which used /bin and /lib instead.  Sharing the combined default OS and local extensions in /usr - minus the homes, lead to UNIX having the split between /bin and /usr/bin.   Later this was leveraged by some dists to make / (with /bin, /lib and so on) as small as possible for booting, and then mount the rest in from /usr, which now had the majority of the system software.   /var was created later, partly during the push to split /etc into separate areas for configuration and state persistence, which would let /etc be potentially mounted read-only
   * The symlinks you describe for /bin /sbin and so on come from this shift of most software into /usr - despite the irony that this was once **the** directory for user homes
* Many experienced users will end up with \~/bin \~/lib and so on in a process much like that which originally created /usr/bin and /usr/lib - just not shared with other users
* /usr/local is still intended for site-specific stuff, and should always be empty or absent in a distro.  It's convenient to use this as a mount point for your local software, and directories like /usr/local/bin and so on are common
* Keep /mnt empty most of the time.  It is expected that this is a free mount point for temporary mounts
* In complex, multiarchitecture sites, shared software directories will often pick up an added path component specific to an architecture, even in user's own setups.  My $PATH, for example, contains something like \~/abi/x86\_64-ubu-2204/bin - notionally \~/abi/$HOSTABI/bin ($HOSTABI is a var my dotfiles create in my top-level shell at login).  /usr/local sometimes sees similar treatment
* The ""wild .west""  had some advantages, in that all the config a given program would be in \~/.<program>rc  - clearing out all the program's state was dead simple   The weakness of this model was that it could confuse programs when a user was logged into multiple computers sharing the **same** $HOME over NFS (**like I am right now**).  So a way to have host-specific parts was needed, but never popularly addressed.  The XDG system also totally fails to solve this, so no real progress has happened.  I've configured my stuff to point the XDG directories like \~/.local into /dev/shm/xdg/.local, where links in **there** point back into host-specific config directories under \~ .... but this is **not** a good answer for most people and simply proves how much of a failure the XDG thing actually is.  It provides **only** a finite number of paths, which lets something like my insane use of shm be effective, but XDG makes **no** attempt to solve the issue more cleanly than that.

Plan9 has some tools that allow the user to just merge all the (e.g.) ""bin"" directories' content into a single /bin and thus wildly shorten the $PATH.  In Linux, we expect to see $PATH with a long string of bin and sbin directories, which some being decorated with architecture-specific bits and $HOME.  This is... fine... I suppose, but there are times, when, even outside of Plan 9, I miss that the Apollo version of UNIX would dynamically expand variables in symlinks, so you could make a symlink that would **hide** the, say, $HOSTABI, part, and end up with a much cleaner $PATH as a result.  Somehow I'm sure someone got nervous about how this Apollo facility could be abused... :-)",['linux'],this is long and generally good but home is not standard but a convenience choice for tiny simple sites it does not scale to large sites where home might look like nfssomehostnamedisknameusername or be buried in afs the andrew filesystem or something else arcane historically usr had user home directories but those teams built up too much useful software in directories they shared there like usrlocal usrbin usrlib etc notably not yet part of the underlying unix which used bin and lib instead sharing the combined default os and local extensions in usr minus the homes lead to unix having the split between bin and usrbin later this was leveraged by some dists to make with bin lib and so on as small as possible for booting and then mount the rest in from usr which now had the majority of the system software var was created later partly during the push to split etc into separate areas for configuration and state persistence which would let etc be potentially mounted readonly the symlinks you describe for bin sbin and so on come from this shift of most software into usr despite the irony that this was once the directory for user homes many experienced users will end up with bin lib and so on in a process much like that which originally created usrbin and usrlib just not shared with other users usrlocal is still intended for sitespecific stuff and should always be empty or absent in a distro its convenient to use this as a mount point for your local software and directories like usrlocalbin and so on are common keep mnt empty most of the time it is expected that this is a free mount point for temporary mounts in complex multiarchitecture sites shared software directories will often pick up an added path component specific to an architecture even in users own setups my path for example contains something like abixububin notionally abihostabibin hostabi is a var my dotfiles create in my toplevel shell at login usrlocal sometimes sees similar treatment the wild west had some advantages in that all the config a given program would be in programrc clearing out all the programs state was dead simple the weakness of this model was that it could confuse programs when a user was logged into multiple computers sharing the same home over nfs like i am right now so a way to have hostspecific parts was needed but never popularly addressed the xdg system also totally fails to solve this so no real progress has happened ive configured my stuff to point the xdg directories like local into devshmxdglocal where links in there point back into hostspecific config directories under but this is not a good answer for most people and simply proves how much of a failure the xdg thing actually is it provides only a finite number of paths which lets something like my insane use of shm be effective but xdg makes no attempt to solve the issue more cleanly than that plan has some tools that allow the user to just merge all the eg bin directories content into a single bin and thus wildly shorten the path in linux we expect to see path with a long string of bin and sbin directories which some being decorated with architecturespecific bits and home this is fine i suppose but there are times when even outside of plan i miss that the apollo version of unix would dynamically expand variables in symlinks so you could make a symlink that would hide the say hostabi part and end up with a much cleaner path as a result somehow im sure someone got nervous about how this apollo facility could be abused,positive

1nc1jui,Tech,linux,"How to (actually) install a Linux operating system on a Chromebook I’m pissed.
The other day I helped my friend remove chrome os from their Chromebook and install Linux, but the process was a lot more painful than it should have been. All the articles I found disagreed with each other or didn’t give a straight answer, so I’m here to put all that in one place. One straightforward post with everything you need to know in order to install Linux on a Chromebook.

Dependencies:
You must have a Chromebook that is compatible with the BIOS installer script. You can easily tell if your Chromebook is capable by going into your Chromebook’s recovery screen. If it looks like the image attached then this tutorial should work. If it doesn’t, there’s probably an article somewhere else.

You also need a bootable usb with a Linux image flashed to it. If you don’t, and you don’t have any other device you can use to flash the drive, then use this tutorial on how to use a Chromebook to create Linux images. ( https://runtimeterror.dev/burn-an-iso-to-usb-with-the-chromebook-recovery-utility )

Disclaimers:
Doing this is not in any way supported by chrome. Installing a non native BIOS and operating system WILL void most warranties you have on your Chromebook. Doing this also erases any local data on your disk, and depending on your Linux image, will also erase chrome os.

Tutorial:
With all that jargon out of the way, here’s how you actually do it.

1. Developer mode; open up your computer’s recovery screen (power + refresh + esc), and use arrow keys and enter to navigate to advanced options > developer mode. Once you click developer mode, click past any of the warnings it shows you. Once you do this, and wait for the mode transition to finish, it should open up the developer mode screen. Use arrow keys to navigate and select “boot from internal disk”
2. Installing BIOS; Most Chromebooks don’t come with bios, so we have to use a third party script to install them. After enabling developer mode and booting back into chrome os, log into your device normally and get to the desktop. Once at the desktop, press ctrl + alt + refresh to open the VT2 terminal. (This terminal is required to use sudo permissions and write firmware). Once in the VT2 terminal, type “curl -LO mrchromebox.tech/firmware-util.sh && sudo bash firmware-util.sh” and wait for the tool to install and run. Once in the tool, type 1 and press enter. This should install BIOS. After that process finishes, type P and press enter. This should shut down the Chromebook.
3. Entering third party bios; Once you power on your Chromebook again after installing bios, plug in your Linux boot device and use arrow keys to navigate to the option “use alternate bootloader” in the developer mode screen. Then select the option that shows up above cancel, and click esc when you see the bios loading screen.
4. Install Linux; Now that you are in the bios, select the option to boot from a usb device. If your Chromebook has more than one usb port, it may take some trial and error to find which usb option is the one that your boot device is plugged into. Once you find it, your Chromebook should boot into Linux. From there install your Linux distro according to its guide.

1nby02g,Tech,linux,"i can't go back to windows now and i absolutely despise it a simple `stat /` command says that it has almost been 5 months since i made the big switch. nothing hard. just backed up my windows ssd, said my final goodbye to the operating system that just handled me for a year roughly. and booted into freedom.

i had some previous experience with linux, 2 years ago. once with arch and once with ubuntu, and in both of them i had no idea what i was doing. i used them as a throw-away boot-from-usb Operating system as i was involved in some ""journalism""

i then reverted back to windows because any shit i tried did not work and i just didnt understand what i was doing.

fast forward a year, i got into homelabbing and servers, and i just really enjoyed wasting my time on the terminal. it is just so elegant and made me so productive, i really enjoyed working on it. learnt some very very basic commands.

and exactly 2 months and 28 days later, after being sick of windows, it failing to install redis on and or docker, wsl failing, extreme slowness and supreme lagging by my windows 11 pro, downloading the distro and receiving my 512 gb gen3 nvme stick, backing up all the necessary data, it was done. the time had come to switch. i purchased an nvme to sata adapter to attach into the spare sata slot in my laptop, just in the dire case that i would need to access the data i had on my windows ssd ever. (spoiler alert: good idea)

the distro i chose was fedora 42, i was a big fan of rhel, and i went with kde plasma because i didn't like gnome when i used arch and ubuntu (yes i am an idiot i used gnome on arch i will never do that again). i went with kde plasma this time even after friends convincing me not to saying ""i'd spend too much time on ricing""

and in the last 5 months. i have changed. i have become a very different man. i have evolved in ways no one else can describe. i think i have upgraded to my superior form. yes thats the feeling. 

my computer is a lenovo v330 with 20gb of ram (16+4s) and i3 8th gen. yes it does suck but i use it as a beheaded laptop and remove the backplate when running a cpu intensive script and it keeps it at 70-75.

this machine absolutely gutted at windows, i mean it was slow but even using microsoft edge was hard. things it sucked the most was i/o and ram management.

now that i have switched to fedora, it is fast. it is light and it is fast. it is bloated but i dont mind it because i plugin my 2 decade old printer and it works. that shit doesnt happen in windows does it? 

fedora and linux just made me so much better. need redis? one command away? need to run 89 commands together, split thy terminal, need updating colors on your screen with no reason whatsoever? btop is your friend. it is just so intuitive and just so faster than windows.

i have got some issues like obsidian not generating pdfs or using boomaga shortcuts, some security stuff and permissions mainly. not anything that has severely limited my abilities. some features i miss from windows are the sandbox, which led to the creation of very quick virtual machines, i mean i have that option on fedora too but it still isnt that fast. i dont use photoshop or play games so i dont feel that much of a brunt. i do feel if i had some proper bootable media creator like rufus, because the cli alternative just doesnt do a great job.

however a problem is that i have started to hate windows, every time i use windows, be it 7, 10 or 11, it just lags and that lag kills me. if i see any laptop with that blue screen it instantly triggers my ptsd, it has gotten so bad that i have had a couple nightmares of working on a windows pc and it hanging so bad i woke up being annoyed. some people might find it funny but i am serious. let's just say i have had a very bad experience and perhaps trauma associated with struggling hardware in the past.

this is making me a very toxic person overall, perhaps even a circlejerk, i bully people that complain about performance and not use linux or people that were scammed when buying new expensive laptops, and i now think that no one needs an expensive laptop, or something more powerful than a t14/p15/t480, because playing games that need expensive hardware is a sin and a laptop is meant to be portable and not for gaming. there is no portable laptop without a good battery pack. that doesnt exist in gaming laptops.

and yeah that is how it is going currently. i was more accepting of people when it started. i just now feel like i know it all. like i am the supreme being. like i own everything. and it is just perfect.

i have also convinced myself that i would be undervolting the next laptop i buy (perhaps a t480) and running arch on it because maybe then i will feel more perfect than i am. and linux will handle the performance issues.

anyway

the only fair amount of ricing i've done is have an LLM write a bash script to save my variables and color choice, and use starship with kitty. im enjoying it till now. everything feels good. everything feels under control. nice. good.

	•	Issues: some PDF generation quirks, security/permissions, no Rufus alternative as good, VM speed not as snappy as Windows sandbox.

	•	Doesn’t game or use Photoshop, so Linux covers his needs perfectly.

	•	Now hates Windows to the point of “trauma” (nightmares about lag, PTSD from blue screens).

	•	Admits he’s gotten a bit toxic—bullies people for using Windows/expensive laptops, believes gaming laptops are pointless.

	•	Plans: undervolt a ThinkPad (maybe T480) and run Arch for “ultimate perfection.”

Its possible to have the best of both worlds

up to date kernel, mesa or whatever from arch and stable applications from debian

getting apt to work and install itself is a pain, i had to download the packages in a debian 13 vm copy them over and install them in the correct order

installing readline from debian (dependency for bash) made it impossible to log in, i had to chroot in and fix it

you need to know which package manager has which packages installed, removing packages from one can break the other

you need to change some symlinks and directories

also i dont remember exactly what i did

first change the repo to the arch linux archive from 2025/07/31

then install dpkg from pacman

get all the dependencies for apt from debian 13 and install them in the correct order, just guess around until it works

once apt is installed you can remove dpkg with pacman, an apt version of dpkg will remain

then you can start installing some stuff you need for apt to work correctly (awk, bash, coreutils, python, perl, readline, pam, less, libsigsegv and some more i forgot)

ndb3td1,Tech,linux,"nan Stop thinking about it from what *you* want, and start understanding what companies need. There is a massive spectrum of jobs that ""involve"" Linux:

* If you can program, there are a lot of jobs (in everything from frontend to backend  to database to embedded to games, etc)
* If you are a 'weak' programmer, but can still write scripts, you can do ""DevOps"". (This can include some systadmin, some DB admin, some troubleshooting, some IT, etc.)
* If you can't program, but you can still navigate the intricacies of installing software, you can be a SysAdmin. But these days, software is so easy to install that few companies hire a pure sysadmin -- they want the automate aspect, so they vastly prefer DevOps.
   * In the old days, being able to identify bottlenecks and tweak Linux to be 20% faster was sometimes worth millions. But now Linux does a good job of optimizing itself, so there is much less work to ""do"" that isn't in other areas (DevOps, security, etc) 
* If you know databases, you can be a DBA. But just like ""sysadmin"", doing ""DBA"" work is easier, so most companies would rather hire a programmer who knows a bit about databases.
* If you know a lot about hardware, and can navigate software usages, you can be an IT person. Your usefulness isn't ""how much you know"", but how much you know relative to a specific company.
   * If you network with local people as a ""computer guy"", they will often have problems and bring you on to solve them. If you do this a few times, you will have a reputation for being the local computer expert.  (But watch out, most companies run Windows. Getting companies to switch is a completely different career.)
* If you have a very logical mind, you might become involved in cybersecurity. This involves keeping up with the latest hacks, but mostly involves relating the ""threats"" out there to the specific goals of the organization. It's too easy to say ""everything they are doing is risky"", which isn't valuable.

  
Keep in mind the knowledge required to manage a Linux Desktop is vastly different managing a Linux Server. (Only a little bit of overlap.)

8. No creepy software stealing my data and IP.
9. Many games can run on Linux without using things like Proton to mimic Windows. Some games have an anti-cheat system, so they can't run on Linux - I'd just play them on PS4/5. No issues with game performance, but it does not support 2560\*1080 for Resident Evil 6 on an ultrawide screen, it didn't scale properly.
10. It does freeze or crash, but not often enough to bother me. When it happens, it's for a reason and not random crashing. Sometimes, certain software doesn't open or install properly,so just switch to a different one.

1nb60ml,Tech,linux,"My Return to Linux  - Extra Long I want to share my raw experience of returning to Linux, and show what it's like switching. I documented what I could. For any new users, it's not just you. It's definitely a whole different beast, and it's different for everyone.

First things first I hunted for a distro and I, like most, looked at the most popular currently used. This led me to three choices; EndeavourOS, CachyOS, and Mint. I have used Mint before, but it's been over a decade, so in my mind at this point I am thinking it's lacking(how wrong I was), or too simplified for what I want. I decide to try Arch for the first time, so I give EndeavourOS a try.

Pretty much I immediately have issues because of third party hardware. I actually tried all three to confirm and saw that Mint was the only to work out of the box, but Mint didn't have the newer drivers for my 9070 XT(this was back in March so immediately after release.) I decided to give Endeavour OS a try first.

I have an Elgato Wave XLR interface for my microphone, and I can tell you this shit was not having it. The hardware was physically working, and was able to be used, technically, but the routing that was happening. Dear god, the fucking routing. I got to the point where it was working, until I opened discord, then that would break it system wide. At this point, this is a deal breaker since discord is pretty much running 24/7.

This leads to the attempt with CachyOS. This is where I realize that this hardware is largely the issue as I was getting the same behavior, and that no matter what I do, there is going to be some issues with it. I eventually found a dance I had to do to get everything working. I had to open the volume mixer(pavucontrol), then easy effects, then I have to toggle it so I can can monitor the mic to have it routed at least once, then toggle off the monitor, close easy effects, and then open discord... AND IT WORKS. As simple as that /s. Fucking hell.

After audio was finally setup, it was time for games. Everything worked. Not much was needed to be done out of the box aside from install Steam and Heroic Launcher for Epic Games. It was awesome to have it just work. My original Linux gaming experience was the original Steam OS, like for the OG Steam Box. I ran Bioshock Infinite and decided to crank the settings up to max. The screen went black, and it never booted again on that install. This time around, thankfully, was not the same experience. Actually, gaming was the easiest part of Linux, which I was expecting, but still surprised that it ""just works."" At least until a certain point, which we'll get to later.

After audio and gaming was figured out, it was time for rice. I started making desklets, and learned a bit about Conky. With some time on the weekend, I had a desklet made for my weather station using it's API. I was, to say the least, pretty fucking stoked. There were some issues related to GPU that was causing some crashes, and eventually I got that fixed.

I continued to use CachyOS for a few weeks, and everything was hunky dory, until after some update, I got the dreaded, feared, flashing cursor... I still have no idea what happened as I wasn't working on anything specific when this happened, but this is when I decided if it's going to be a reinstall, it's time to give EndeavourOS another chance. Also, the DE would not work for the life of me.

And... Everything went well. Pretty much as easy to setup as CachyOS, except for getting packages and programs installed, sans package installer. Even then, it wasn't too bad, until I had to install my Plex client. I'm sorry Plex, but through some means I violated that client and it did things it was never supposed to do. Eventually, I got it installed *correctly*, and everything was good. Now there were some recurring issues that were frustrating. USB randomly stopped working, even though I could see it was working, it just refused to actually function correctly without a reboot. I never got SMB working either and it seems I am not alone in that either. There was also the issue of random system crashing(Keep your BIOS up to date kids.)

Games ran fine, I was able to do my day to day stuff I needed, and nothing really happened. Until it did. I can't even blame EndeavourOS. I am pretty sure it was the evil one, the one I ran from. I had to go back, and I paid the cost. I needed to go back to Windows for some logins that weren't in my password manager, and apparently it had an update. The rest is history. Somehow, through some means, EndeavourOS was killed. I don't even know what happened, as Windows and Linux were on separate SSDs, and shouldn't be able to touch those partitions, but that was all she wrote. But as retribution, I did take Windows out back and gave her the good Ol' Yeller. I was not having any of that shit that night.

This means, it's time for Mint. Sweet, sweet Mint. How I doubted you. Now that I have some more experience under my belt, it should be way easier right? Right? Well, let me tell you about how that works. It doesn't. Until you try again, then it does. Makes sense? Nope. As I said before, since the 9070 XT is so new, you need the mesa drivers for it, which are not included with Mint. I learned how to install these when I was playing with it before, and I knew it was possible because of a certain content creator using the GPU with Mint already. Well for whatever reason, the mesa install just didn't work. Until I reinstalled Mint. Then it did. How in the fuck.

After this Mint worked well. Like, really well. The package installer was by far, my favorite part of setting up Mint. I'm pretty sure, that while Arch is cool, Ubuntu/Debian distros are for me. Everything just worked. I even figured out from another post somewhere on the interwebs that you can't use the input and output on the Elgato Wave XLR, or you'll see the issues I am having. No idea how I missed this during my research but oh well. Gaming was perfect until there were non steam games that I wanted to play. Remember how I said I used the Heroic Launcher? Well that's just for Epic Games, and now it's time for Ubisoft. With a quick google search, it seems Lutris is the answer to all of my questions. How the fuck does this shit work? I don't know, it didn't work for me. I am pretty sure it was an Ubisoft Connect update as Epic games seemed to work, but I couldn't figure it out as almost every guide was for pirated games. That led me to NSL(NonSteamLaunchers). I am pretty sure it would have worked, but I think there was an issue with that version where it failed during install and kept looping, and by the time the dev responded to my dumb ass giving them the wrong log file(sorry for not responding,) I had already found my solution.

Bottles. Now I know what Wine is, but Bottles? This was all new to me. How could it be so easy? Is this the future? No, it's the present and I love it. Within an hour, I was playing Division 2 and RDR2 with no issues(that weren't my own fault.) I do still have the issue of the Ubisoft bottle disappearing after a few days. It might be fixed, might not be, I'll find out in \*checks notes\* a few days.

Now, I know it sounds like I am gassing Mint up, but I experienced the *most* issues in Mint, than the other distros. Bluetooth? Yeah right, my wireless chipset is shit on this motherboard(MT7921.) Random desktop freezing? Check. Sleep and screen timeout settings? Sometimes gets ignored. DE disappearing? Happens to the best of us. When PC goes to sleep and locks(not supposed to do either), wrong password. Reboot. Correct password! Elgato setting to 100% every login? Probably not Mint's fault, but only happens on Mint. All valid issues, but none of them are system breaking, and not nearly the same amount of effort of dealing with Microsoft's shit. I can tell clearly what is happening

And now we're to this past week. Destiny Rising came out. To play on PC you have to use an emulator. Well, NetEase has MumuPlayer for playing it. Simple right? Right? No. It's only simple when it is, and never when it should be. There is really one main Android emulator on Linux, and that's Waydroid. This is one of those moments I got frustrated and realized there are users on the internet that are in no way helpful, or nice. The classic Linux experience I forgot about. The ""why are you trying to do that"" or ""why do you *want* to do that."" Because I do? And their best suggestion is not to do that? Fuck off. Why is it Windows has a million different emulators that all can do it and linux has one that *might*? Ok, to be fair it worked on the beta, but there are still hoops to jump through to find out that it doesn't work on release. It's pretty frustrating. So, it's another return to Windows.

Linux has spoiled me. Every time I go back to Windows, I am sure my blood pressure rises. No, like I actually get angry at Windows. It's like having an unskippable ad on a YouTube video even though you have adblock. Every followup after an update where you tell it no five times. Every startup program that is a pain in my ass(looking you ghub.) Programs suddenly installed after updates. Like when the fuck did Slack get installed? I have never used Slack a day in my life. Don't even get me going on One Drive showing up whenever it feels like. I'll evict One Drive as many times as I have to. Oh, Windows updated? Have fun fixing your audio fucko. And the recent SSD bug?

Overall, Linux is probably ready for the average Joe. Or not. I can't really tell as every user is different, and it seems everyone will have a slightly(or massively) different experience on Linux. Gaming is pretty good. Productivity is pretty good. But both are maybes, depending on the user. The biggest issue I had is no first party support. It's to be expected, but it's still disappointing. It's a paradoxical situation. Developers won't develop, so users don't use. Linux user eventually asks, not enough user interest to develop. Cycle repeats. More people have to use Linux for developers to even consider, but more software needs to be supported by first party developers for users to be able to switch to Linux.

nczjvgi,Tech,linux,"nan Lo, a fellow did resolve to grant fair Linux another chance, and so did he assay sundry distros: EndeavourOS, CachyOS, and Mint. Yet forthwith was he beset by grievous quarrels with his hardware, most chiefly his Elgato mic and Discord, which did conspire to sow discord indeed. After strange and crooked remedies most unnatural, his audio at last did consent to behave.

As for gaming? Verily smooth — Steam and Epic did serve him well enough, yet Ubisoft and sundry others proved but a torment most foul.

1nh726m,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"Need some direction on want to do post lay off Iive been working help desk and customer service roles for about 3 to 4 years now.

Recently I was laid off from my help Desk position at an MSP who had to cut the jobs of 12 people. I'm using this time to upscale and re-enter the job market for better opportunities above entry level help desk, or at least help desk get a company that isn't a small business contract sweat shop that makes money off of Old Windows server and office 365 management. I like programming but since software development is tanking I'm not prioritizing a traditional programmer job. 

In the meantime I'm getting contacted for recruiters for some shitty jobs like only offering $20 an hour to reimage and box up computers which isn't something I'm interested in.

And I sure as hell don't want an entry level help desk job doing stupid password resets and using my brain power for trivial technical bullshit like fixing some old person's display settings or locating and missing bookmark. I'd rather stay unemployed than take a job like that. 

I'm also nervous to even consider accepting a job at a small MSP for the same reason that I was just laid off. If it's a small business that depends on boomer generation infrastructure to make money, there's no guarantee how long there will be work for all they need is to lose a few clients for the business to go under which is exactly what happened with my last job. Especially since some of these companies here aren't even involved in cloud for automation at all and their clients are probably getting picked up by companies that are offering cloud solutions and automation workflows. The money just also isn't that good at those kinds of companies, it feels like a much smaller league and the work is mostly kind of boring and frustrating yet for some reason these companies don't feel like they have to adapt I don't know what it is I think it's a boomer gen mentality especially in nepotist style workplaces. 

So that being said -

I did just pass the network+ and I don't think I'm gonna go for the Sec+. I'm looking at mid level certifications now like the RHCSA or the AWS SAA. I have time to really skill up now to get something above help desk, and I'm concerned that if I accept a help desk job at just any company I'll get locked into whatever legacy crap they do weather it be old Windows server environments or on prem office 365 and then in the interview I say something like how I'm working towards RHCSA, cloud certs, or practicing python by creating projects I'll get a ""we don't do that here"" and then I'll accept the job because I need to get working again but get sort of skill capped in a job k can't really grow out of because all of my time is dedicated to supporting their legacy crap for their mom and pops businesses they support only to get laid off AGAIN because they start losing clients to better companies who like actually do manage cloud solutions and automation for overall cheaper services.

1nh4n7q,Tech,linux,"MX Master 3 on Linux: Chrome/Chromium-specific Smart Shift gestures + GNOME workspace gestures with Solaar # TL;DR:

With ChatGPT’s help I used Solaar to make Smart Shift handle Chrome-only tab gestures and the Thumb Gesture button control GNOME workspaces (like macOS Mission Control). Config + notes below.

# The backstory

Coming from Windows (and a bit of macOS), I was used to Logitech Options+ giving me tons of power with my MX Master 3. Moving to Linux, I thought I’d have to give that up.  
After hours of frustration and experimenting, ChatGPT helped me figure out **Solaar rules** to replicate (and even improve) the behavior I had before.

Yes, I know Chrome isn’t open source 🙈 … but hey, I’m just starting out on Linux. One step at a time — slowly detoxing from closed-source stuff.

# The goal

* **Smart Shift button (under the scroll wheel):**
   * `Ctrl+W` on click
   * `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` on hold+left
   * `Ctrl+Tab` on hold+right
   * `Ctrl+Shift+T` on hold+down → *Only active in Chrome/Chromium*
* **Thumb Gesture button (on the side):**
   * Left = prev workspace
   * Right = next workspace
   * Up = GNOME Overview (Mission Control)
   * Down = Show Desktop
   * Click without moving = Overview

ngzohsx,Law,legaltech,"nan Most law firms have already moved toward minimum rate billables, so for many things there is no need to track actual time.

The most obvious example of this is emails. Every firm I have worked at bills emails at a minimum rate of 0.2 (12 minutes). Doesn't matter if the email only took 30 seconds to draft and send.

Likewise for pleading drafting. Depends on the pleading, but let's just say for example a petition has a minimum billable instance of 2.0 (2 hours), motions have billables of 0.5 (30 minutes), etc...

Of course sometimes you would spend more time than the minimum, in which case - yes you need to track and record the time. 

But frankly a lot of this stuff is just automated directly inside of the CRM. Example... You can sync Clio with your email. You send a client an email initiated via Clio and it will automatically record that time. Same with document drafting.

I've never used a tool like what you have described, but I'm curious as to what its usefulness is. I'm not saying that to bash it. Others may find value, and I encourage anyone to chime in here. But from my experience, I don't feel like the tools you have described would add anything I would have wanted that isn't already built into an established CRM.

Frankly, it sounds a little bit like a headache. I don't want to have some robot recording everything my screen does and then attempting to make AI summaries of the time I spent doing those things. That's not how daily life in litigation works. There are interruptions and stuff. I might be working on drafting something and then pause to take a 3 minute phone call... And then resume working on the draft and then see an email come in and then respond to that email... And then my boss walks in and I need to strategize with him about the Jones case. 

None of this is captured by screen capture software and I feel like it would just fuck up my workflow and I would just be running around, correcting a robot that I don't even want in the first place.

nhag9km,Law,legaltech,"nan Hey u/mcnello! Founder of Ajax here; you raise a few really good points:  


1) The Clio <--> Outlook integration isn't bad, as long as you remember to bcc / track each one

2) The bar for not just gunking up your day is really high. There's a reason we (and our competitors) really picked up steam this year; it's because AI has only recently gotten good enough to reliably give you entries that don't take *more time* *to correct* than your existing timekeeping flow.

To that last point, handling interruptions well is the big test for AI timekeepers. Most attorneys we work with live in a constant barrage of emails, calls, in-person meetings, and trying to carve out a little time for actually drafting. A good AI timekeeper can pluck out the related threads of work across the whole day and write a coherent entry. A bad one (WiseTime is notorious for this) will make your entry review time 3x as long as it would have taken to just write your own.

It's not a silver bullet - most people that try Ajax end up being surprised how much they like it, and find a few extra .1s for their trouble, but no tool is going to work for 100% of people. Sounds like you've got a flow that works, so no need to fix what ain't broke!",['clio'],hey umcnello founder of ajax here you raise a few really good points the clio outlook integration isnt bad as long as you remember to bcc track each one the bar for not just gunking up your day is really high theres a reason we and our competitors really picked up steam this year its because ai has only recently gotten good enough to reliably give you entries that dont take more time to correct than your existing timekeeping flow to that last point handling interruptions well is the big test for ai timekeepers most attorneys we work with live in a constant barrage of emails calls inperson meetings and trying to carve out a little time for actually drafting a good ai timekeeper can pluck out the related threads of work across the whole day and write a coherent entry a bad one wisetime is notorious for this will make your entry review time x as long as it would have taken to just write your own its not a silver bullet most people that try ajax end up being surprised how much they like it and find a few extra s for their trouble but no tool is going to work for of people sounds like youve got a flow that works so no need to fix what aint broke,positive
ngzqlz1,Law,legaltech,"nan Appreciate the candid response. 

To clarify, Ajax and PointOne both record screens but what I'm building and what Billables does is not screen recording at all.

The idea is to integrate with all of the tools you use. Email, phone calls, whatsapp chats, microsoft word, google docs, adobe, zoom, google meet etc. etc.

Then as you use these tools in your day to day activities, logs will be fetched from the APIs these tools offer and based on these logs, billing entries would be automatically generated. Also based on these logs, each entry will be automatically matched to the client matter you performed the activity for.

You spend a quick 5 minutes at the end of the day to review and edit the entries and press ""approve"" to sync the entries into whatever practice management software (Clio etc.) you use.

As for minimum billable rates, that's perfectly fine. Whenever we detect an email, we can record a 0.2, for example.",['clio'],appreciate the candid response to clarify ajax and pointone both record screens but what im building and what billables does is not screen recording at all the idea is to integrate with all of the tools you use email phone calls whatsapp chats microsoft word google docs adobe zoom google meet etc etc then as you use these tools in your day to day activities logs will be fetched from the apis these tools offer and based on these logs billing entries would be automatically generated also based on these logs each entry will be automatically matched to the client matter you performed the activity for you spend a quick minutes at the end of the day to review and edit the entries and press approve to sync the entries into whatever practice management software clio etc you use as for minimum billable rates thats perfectly fine whenever we detect an email we can record a for example,positive
nh04w1l,Law,legaltech,"nan I think you didn't quite catch what I wrote. Time keeping is already integrated into the CLM. In Clio, I select my client and then push the ""send email"" button. It will automatically create a billable entry. I have document automation integrated into Clio... I select my client and then select the ""Draft Petition"" button and it will automatically draft a petition and create a billable entry.

I don't see how paying for an entirely separate system will help at all. What time will I save? The billable entry is already recorded on the client's invoice.

For billable entries that are manually recorded and take place outside of clio, I am very skeptical that you can do what you claim you can do in an efficient manner. If I'm researching case law on LexisAdvance, how will you know what client it's for? How will you account for interruptions and phone calls, and when my boss walks into my office?

There is a reason attorneys record their time throughout the day as they work on things. Trying to remember what you did for every 6 minute increment throughout the entire workday is literally impossible.

I wouldn't even trust myself to approve the AI generated summary. What if it misses something for one client, and bills it to the wrong client? I honestly probably won't even catch the mistake even with your AI generated summary. I will only know I made the mistake when some angry client calls my office to complain he is getting billed for work that was completed for other clients. How embarrassing that would be...

No.

nguemqy,Law,LawFirm,"nan I did a top level software stack review of the only 5 stacks I would consider if I was starting a firm a few weeks ago. LeanLaw is the only one without native document management so that leaves you with 4 options (on my list).

All 4 handle what you are looking for provided that you choose the right subscription level.

Here is a link to the post: [Software Stack Examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawFirmAccounting/s/Li83woc7oL)

If you look at pricing, Smokeball, Clio, and FileVine are all in the same area price wise. The only decisions you’re making are which subscription level you want.

Clio vs Smokeball: Clio is more of a “design your own system however you want” and Smokeball is more “turnkey with options to customize”.

Clio crushes it marketing wise because their pitch is what attorneys want to hear.. “you can build it however you want”. This is great until 30 days in when the attorney is still looking at basically a shell and realizes they actually have to build it out. Clio also has a nickel and dime feel to it where you’re always looking for something not included and they charge for certain integrations which really rubs me the wrong way.

The above issue with Clio is why I prefer Smokeball. I’ve seen it used well in firms from litigation to estate planning to full service firms. It’s a lot easier to tweak an existing system (and be able to pick between what’s worth tweaking and what’s “good enough” as-is.

FileVine is marketed heavily towards contingency practices, but is a solid system.

MyCase barely makes the top 5. They ended up a bit behind the curve and are the cheapest for that reason. They just did a full re-branding so we will see if that is just branding or if the parent company is actually putting money into MyCase or just living off the LawPay fees (LawPay and MyCase are owned by the same company).

Avoid LEAP & ActionStep. They are highly outdated, have a steep learning curve, and there are countless complaints on faulty integrations. They are also known for being difficult to export data.

Note - Use the payment processor native to the PM, do not just use LawPay just because of brand value. The main benefit is that it is one less piece of software to learn, pricing is no different, and if you want to push transaction fees for credit cards to clients, you can only do this with the native payment processor to the PM (where billing occurs).","['clio', 'lawpay', 'smokeball', 'filevine']",i did a top level software stack review of the only stacks i would consider if i was starting a firm a few weeks ago leanlaw is the only one without native document management so that leaves you with options on my list all handle what you are looking for provided that you choose the right subscription level here is a link to the post software stack examples if you look at pricing smokeball clio and filevine are all in the same area price wise the only decisions youre making are which subscription level you want clio vs smokeball clio is more of a design your own system however you want and smokeball is more turnkey with options to customize clio crushes it marketing wise because their pitch is what attorneys want to hear you can build it however you want this is great until days in when the attorney is still looking at basically a shell and realizes they actually have to build it out clio also has a nickel and dime feel to it where youre always looking for something not included and they charge for certain integrations which really rubs me the wrong way the above issue with clio is why i prefer smokeball ive seen it used well in firms from litigation to estate planning to full service firms its a lot easier to tweak an existing system and be able to pick between whats worth tweaking and whats good enough asis filevine is marketed heavily towards contingency practices but is a solid system mycase barely makes the top they ended up a bit behind the curve and are the cheapest for that reason they just did a full rebranding so we will see if that is just branding or if the parent company is actually putting money into mycase or just living off the lawpay fees lawpay and mycase are owned by the same company avoid leap actionstep they are highly outdated have a steep learning curve and there are countless complaints on faulty integrations they are also known for being difficult to export data note use the payment processor native to the pm do not just use lawpay just because of brand value the main benefit is that it is one less piece of software to learn pricing is no different and if you want to push transaction fees for credit cards to clients you can only do this with the native payment processor to the pm where billing occurs,positive

I have some big cases that are about to wrap up, so I have a good chance of hitting 7 figures this year in gross revenue. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I could hit 7 figures gross when I started my practice nine years ago. 

We're down to two full time legal assistants and one full time paralegal. All live overseas. The paralegal is training the legal assistants so they will be considered more paralegals here soon. They're getting better day by day. One of the legal assistants handles all of the intakes, so I got rid of the call answering service. 

The phone does not stop ringing. We have started to turn down quite a lot of business. I will consider hiring an associate next year, but I'm still on the fence about it. I've seen too many horror stories of EP firms hiring associates, and then they leave after a couple of years. I don't want to go through the hassle of constantly training a new associate every few years. I'd rather just turn down business.

My long-time SEO firm is going to do a re-work of my entire website. I've been using them for six years now and have had incredible results. The website is a bit dated since they updated it six years ago, so it's time for a fresh rebuild, so they can ramp up the SEO presence even more.

Fax: Srfax

Phone: Google voice and numberbarn

Call Answering: Got rid of call answering services after many years. They work great, but time to utilize someone in-house. 

Credit Card: Heartland. 

Case management: Google Drive. My paralegal is custom building our own practice management software. It will be just for our estate planning, probate, and medicaid. Pretty excited about it. 

Accounting: Quickbooks

Timekeeping: Harvest

Drafting: Westlaw

Email: Zoho

**SEO/Advertising**

Phone doesn't stop ringing; it's tough to keep up. We're getting closer to 300 Google reviews between all of the different office locations. I haven't been able to write as much as I wanted to this year since I've been so god damn busy. I'm just going to have my SEO firm re-write a bunch of the content when we do our website relaunch this upcoming year. 

**Rental Properties/Side hustles/Investing**

Closed on another couple of properties recently. The total number of doors is 24, plus two commercial properties. We basically have a full time handy man now who is handling our remodels/upkeep. We just finished our Italy property remodel and it'll start renting this upcoming summer when it's peak season. If any redditors want to use it for cheap, just PM me. We love going there.

You can replicate the same. 1. Make sure the account you’re using on whichever LLM you prefer is strictly being used for business. Go into the settings and provide instructions. Prompt engineering is a thing and is vital, do a little research if needed. Prompt it with: “You are a legal assistant / legal document processor for ABC law firm in __ state. The firm practices X, Y, Z law. Your role is to blank, blank, blank. Do not ever make information up, do not ever ___”

2. Always start a new chat per new document / task and provide it with the appropriate prompt for that specific task. Have them saved somewhere so you can copy and paste as needed. Example: “You will be provided a residential lease agreement. Thoroughly analyze and review all sections. And generate a list of restrictions along with the reference section for each” etc.

3. Make sure you are using the appropriate model. For example: OpenAI has several models to choose from. My personal experience is that gpt 5 has not been that great. Some models are more for coding. Others are great for deep thought and some for visual analysis. You’re probably going to want one of the latter.

Action plan:

Put the matter number in every subject and use a clear naming rule for drafts vs finals.

\- Track errors in a neutral log; after two weeks, take the data and the workflow to the partner as “this protects clients and the firm,” not a personality fight.

\- Designate the receptionist as your file coordinator with limited authority (calendaring, service, medical records, follow‑ups). Cheaper than burning attorney time.

\- Self‑manage only high‑risk items (court filings, OC calls) until trust is earned; everything else runs through your checklist.

ng4upp0,Law,LawFirm,"nan I think most books are overly general/anecdotal/outdated for experienced attorneys. It’s enjoyable to read, but they fall short on the question of “what do I actually need to do to get started?” Here’s what I’ve learned stepping away from a large firm to establish my own law firm and my own accounting firm from scratch.

For experienced attorneys that do not need help on actually practicing law, I always suggest to start with generating fees and working backwards. 

Working backwards for a PI firm:
- Disbursement of a Settlement
- Work on a good (net positive) settlement generation
- Good process to manage client load non-attorney work
- Good client signed up
- Good response time to calls
- Good lead generated
- Good marketing placement

To do “good” on each of these, there is naturally a bad way to do it. 

PI is a B2C business which means you must generate and convert quality leads quickly. 

Overly focusing on trying to filter out bad leads by reducing spending or having a budget that assumes an unrealistic lead conversion rate is the quickest way to generate no leads. Perfect is the enemy of good.

Instead of 50 metrics for marketing that sort of matter, here are 4:

- Ratio of Total Leads to Qualified Leads

- Cost Per Qualified Lead per each marketing channel (website/billboard/paid google ads)

- Cost Per Acquired Lead per each marketing channel (website/billboard/paid google ads)

- Average Case Value by marketing channel (website/billboard/paid google ads)

When you know those metrics, you evaluate what works (many can’t do that) and you can also make changes based on what is working.

Now that you know how much matters cost to generate and the average matter value (before any infrastructure cost), you likely know how many matters you need to generate to hit the revenue number you’re thinking of.

Next, you need your basic infrastructure to measure the relevant marketing data and run your practice.

Base infrastructure is: 
- Legal Billing/Trust Account Management/Document Management
- Payment Processor (if you do any fee for services work)
- Accounting
- Payroll (if you have any employees) 
- Credit Card/Spending
- Base Computer Software

Here is my list of “you can’t miss with these products”: https://www.reddit.com/r/LawFirmAccounting/s/7dqmHYTKEe

Avoid “custom legal industry” software whenever possible. Think about it like this: 
- if 1% of the population knows how to use any given piece of software
- then 0.00001% of the population knows how to use any industry specific tool. 

A good example is a CRM like Go High Level (industry agnostic) vs Clio Grow (the same thing but “custom” for law firms) is a good example.

Smaller case value (relative to class action) is going to feel like a speed you have not experienced before… but you will fail if you have the same speed on $50m class action case work that you have on a car accident insurance claim where policy maximums are $100k for the type of claim.

1nm8xmy,Law,LawFirm,"Clients & reverse payment issues I have encountered some issues over the past 90 days that I haven’t previously dealt with in the past 10 years of small law practice. Since inception, I’ve held my law firm accounts (operating and escrow) at Citibank. I just started using LawPay earlier this year because of client demand for credit card payments. Here are the situations below. My question is whether I should consider switching banking relationships and also consider another payment processing service.

1. I had a client pay a pretty hefty flat fee payment via LawPay about 60-90 days ago. Client used Amex. We had started work, then client decided she changed her mind and disputed the transaction with Amex. LawPay took the funds right away out of our account. We contested the dispute with LawPay and provided our engagement agreement which showed flat fee payment, earned upon receipt, fully executed contract, etc. Now, after 60-90 days, still no return of the funds and I expect to not receive them back. No real communication from LawPay either.

2. One month ago, a client sent a small retainer payment to us via LawPay. LawPay sent email showing transaction completed, client indicates money taken out of debit acct, yet no funds were ever deposited into our trust account count. LawPay basically said it’s a problem with Citibank, not them. I’m waiting for Citibank to get back to us on the issue. Not sure how common this is, but first ever for us.

3. A few days ago, 60 days into representation, we found out that a clients flat fee payment was taken out of our account. Apparently client  had asked for it to be returned via his bank, USAA. I went to Citibank and was livid because at no point did the bank notify us of the request or allow us to chime in or even show our engagement agreement. I don’t care so much about the money (not a huge amount), but rather frustrated that Citi would withdraw funds out of our IOLTA account without a heads up, phone call, etc. This client has since apologized and indicated that he had asked his bank right after the wire was initiated to pull it back, but then changed his mind and wanted to continue. Again, my beef isn’t with the client but more so with the bank for just taking funds from my IOLTA without any consultation.

I’m not sure if these are just three black swan events that have occurred around the same time, or whether I have valid concerns and criticisms against LawPay and Citibank. I’m seriously wondering if I should move banking relationships and whether other institutions would “protect” their account holders more than I feel with Citi. We do quite a bit of business and the amounts aren’t necessarily material to our bottom line. But I do have concerns about similar treatment by LawPay or Citibank if this happened to be a 100k flat fee or a 100k retainer, for example.

Thoughts? How should I handle? What would you do?

nfg8w6u,Law,LawFirm,"nan I deal with this a lot and have prior banking experience as well.

The issue is not LawPay. It’s the Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA) applicable to all credit card issuers that protects cardholders.

Step 0 of every dispute is an auto clawback while they investigate. Credit card disputes can regularly take 90 days (potentially longer) to resolve.

You will lose almost all if not all credit card disputes that are not fully earned on receipt (and may even lose some of those). The client can dispute a number of arbitrary items that you cannot “prove” and even then, credit card providers almost always take the side of the consumer client when services are involved. 

Credit Card payment disputes are such an issue that some state bar associations post opinions allowing attorneys to “sweep” credit card payments to a different account so that there is not a commingling issue with other trust funds (you still owe the money and need overdraft protection, but it avoids a commingling issue). 

Depending on your EL language about fixed fees & earned on receipt, you may win this claim. No news after this long likely means AMEX hasn’t given a satisfactory response to LawPay or requested more time to review the engagement letter.

The other issue with disputes is privilege. Other than providing the engagement letter, it is difficult to justify work/circumstances without breaking privilege (i.e. time sheets with privileged items or work product). 

The wire is a weird situation... Once funds settle, the sending bank normally can’t unilaterally pull it back. I’d say the wire was not fully settled. This is odd if it was fully settled.

My biggest piece of advice (if you can get away with it) is to toggle off credit card payments. ACH and E-check transactions are generally limited to disputes about “did you intend to send the money or not” and quality of service is not something that can be disputed.

The ability to dispute credit card payments is part of the reason I suggest all firms toggle on payment processor fees added to the client’s bill if permitted in your jurisdiction and if you accept payment by credit card (you can do this with LawPay, but only if you have MyCase and maybe one other billing platform). It also pushes some to pay with their actual bank account (so they don’t have to pay the processing charge) which has limited dispute reasons and time window.

My position with all big banks is that they are great as long as everything works perfectly. When weird situations happen, you can’t even get a human on the phone and even if you can, they can’t do much to help you. Chase, Capitol One, WFG won’t be any better.

The only thing I think you would get at a smaller bank is maybe a call about the wire. 

The credit card dispute is not in the bank’s realm of responsibility. 

The one about LawPay depositing money at Citi can be a weird situation… or Citi may have a hold on certain inflows due to the recent clawbacks. Banks do normally notify you if they have a hold on inflows or outflows though. 

You should be able to setup notifications with Citi in online banking for transactions over a certain size. 

The only way to avoid clawbacks being a surprise 45 days after the clawback happens is to be actively watching and closing out payments daily with your accounting software, PM, and LawPay integration where you can see odd outflows.",['lawpay'],i deal with this a lot and have prior banking experience as well the issue is not lawpay its the fair credit billing act fcba applicable to all credit card issuers that protects cardholders step of every dispute is an auto clawback while they investigate credit card disputes can regularly take days potentially longer to resolve you will lose almost all if not all credit card disputes that are not fully earned on receipt and may even lose some of those the client can dispute a number of arbitrary items that you cannot prove and even then credit card providers almost always take the side of the consumer client when services are involved credit card payment disputes are such an issue that some state bar associations post opinions allowing attorneys to sweep credit card payments to a different account so that there is not a commingling issue with other trust funds you still owe the money and need overdraft protection but it avoids a commingling issue depending on your el language about fixed fees earned on receipt you may win this claim no news after this long likely means amex hasnt given a satisfactory response to lawpay or requested more time to review the engagement letter the other issue with disputes is privilege other than providing the engagement letter it is difficult to justify workcircumstances without breaking privilege ie time sheets with privileged items or work product the wire is a weird situation once funds settle the sending bank normally cant unilaterally pull it back id say the wire was not fully settled this is odd if it was fully settled my biggest piece of advice if you can get away with it is to toggle off credit card payments ach and echeck transactions are generally limited to disputes about did you intend to send the money or not and quality of service is not something that can be disputed the ability to dispute credit card payments is part of the reason i suggest all firms toggle on payment processor fees added to the clients bill if permitted in your jurisdiction and if you accept payment by credit card you can do this with lawpay but only if you have mycase and maybe one other billing platform it also pushes some to pay with their actual bank account so they dont have to pay the processing charge which has limited dispute reasons and time window my position with all big banks is that they are great as long as everything works perfectly when weird situations happen you cant even get a human on the phone and even if you can they cant do much to help you chase capitol one wfg wont be any better the only thing i think you would get at a smaller bank is maybe a call about the wire the credit card dispute is not in the banks realm of responsibility the one about lawpay depositing money at citi can be a weird situation or citi may have a hold on certain inflows due to the recent clawbacks banks do normally notify you if they have a hold on inflows or outflows though you should be able to setup notifications with citi in online banking for transactions over a certain size the only way to avoid clawbacks being a surprise days after the clawback happens is to be actively watching and closing out payments daily with your accounting software pm and lawpay integration where you can see odd outflows,positive

ng5mj89,Law,LawFirm,"nan Wow, I feel like this question deserved more attention.  Some decent answers, but I don't think any really got to what you were looking for.

If you have 1,000s of pages that you need to have a team collaborate on review, redacting and keeping a privilege log, diligently as all out clients deserve when their info could end up in an exhibit and then out there for anybody who can pull a docket, then you need to use a system like Logikcull.

You can break up the review sets.  Your redactions are burned in when you export out a production.  Bates are easy.  Ect.

Keep the culled stuff in a good DMS where it keeps everything OCR and you can do fancy searches like prox, but while good for some client docs and all work product, using a proper DMS like NetDocuments or Imanage is going to get fairly expensive if you are storing everything you get from a production or client.  You can generally find cheaper storage for old cases and large volumes that don't need to be in the primary DMS.

Clio has that bonus of having unlimited storage, but most wouldn't consider it a true DMS to the same extent NetDocs or iManage is.  Better than nothing, and the matter centric structure, ""ain't for nothing,"" as they say back home.

nexa08x,Law,LawFirm,"nan Make sure you understand what you are asking and what people are responding to.  In Westlaw there is a little thing at the bottom of the screen called CoCounsel.

I don't understand the difference but the actual CoCounsel tool is way better and likely what costs the money.  This is located at https://cocounsel.thomsonreuters.com/.  This allows you to do some research but I have found a lot of its value in document based legal practice.  Yesterday I asked it to proofread my brief and give me the errors in bullet point form.  Caught a lot of things I didn't catch in my read through.  Last week I asked it to review two 500 page contracts that are VERY similar and highlight all the major differences.  Within 10 minutes it spit out a 60 page document highlighting the differences and hyperlinking to the source material for everything.  I also recently used it to review a Complaint and a settlement agreement and it offered some suggestions that were helpful.

  
Now back to the research front.  What is really cool and new is the Westlaw AI Deep Research tool which is basically chat gpt for legal concepts except its actually good at the law.  And since its a closed system it has to cite EVERYTHING.

1nvq8l5,Law,Paralegal,"Learning to do my job w/o AI. Accepted new job doing insurance bad faith litigation (drafting, filing and amending petitions) about two months ago. 

Before this I worked in corporate litigation for about two years on civil orders, postponement of administrative hearings and dismissals - very little variation day to day and I hardly ever saw my managing attorney. 

Never used AI as my job never really required it as this job had little to no client communication other than in person administrative hearings. The type of docs I filed then were very boilerplate/ template as it pertained to delinquent government receivables. 

Left as I was approaching my two year mark w no opportunities to go up the corporate ladder / no raise during those two years. $16/hourly in TX. 

Now at my current firm, we use all variations of AI (Claude, Chat GPT) which is helpful for writing petitions but I do want to learn how to be a useful paralegal without the usage of AI. Can I manipulate and re-direct the AI to get the output I need for my petitions? Yes but ultimately I feel like I’m not grasping anything bc AI is doing all the big brain work and I just tweak it as I see fit. I am still learning to manage Clio (first timer) for that and beating SOLs (haven’t missed one yet). 

Moving to this job in particular feels like it kind of defeated the purpose of JOP hopping in the first place as I do want to be a more well-rounded paralegal who can do a bit of discovery work such as motions, pleadings and briefs, etc.  but the attorneys here justify not showing me the ropes with “just use AI” for almost everything. I like who I work for and my office is pretty laid back but I worry that whatever I learn here I will only learn to do so with the use of AI.

In my experience, getting old hat attorneys to use new technology is like pulling teeth.

nhm96g1,Tech,sysadmin,"nan No way I can answer that question without knowing a whole lot more. As someone with significant experience with cloud and on prem things; I am not any more 'afraid' of the cloud as I am afraid of a mosquito. What I am afraid of are execs with middling IQs and the egos of MBAs who tell us to 'go cloud we got a good agreement we will save all sorts of money' only to pay 14x more right out of their operational budgets and then look at me like I did it. Bro, the costs were clearly laid out for you. That isn't every environment, but in a highly transactional one it very well may be. If your business can rely on a few cloud apps and a bunch of SaaS applications than have at it. When you start multiplying the number of SaaS apps, spread across 10s of thousands of employees things look different. 

I am lucky that I have leadership listens to us. The current discussion is should we use Azure + kubernetes or Azure + app services and we are serious about the vendor lock in risk. Push comes to shove, we could just buy servers and slap kubernetes on it if MS becomes untenable. Of course, there is an obvious and steep learning curve to 'netes but that may be worth it to remain essentially agile. Fortunately, I am not getting a diktat on that, in fact I am not sure they (my management) even gives a shit if it is Azure or GCP or even running atop some linux boxes in a leased datacenter.

You're getting our routes, they exist in your routing table. YOU are not sending them forward when these drops occur. (because drops on the internet are normal, shit happens, sometimes an entire ISP in India, China, Russia, etc, lays claim to the entire internet, just another Tuesday.)



Maybe if you updated your gear more than never, it might not have so many issues. 



Maybe if you selected a better solution back during the PoC when you and only you got to trial both solutions to unilaterally decide on a direction for the company and spending millions upon millions of dollars, we wouldn't be having this conversation. 



Additionally, you don't even do firewall rules with the NGFWs, so what does it fucking matter?

Now that that's settled, why have a deadline (which was already accelerated in the first place) to just move it up again in the future? Why have dates at all? Why have work hours at all? We should just work until its done like the overtime exempt slaves we are, right?

Also, I've proven how its cheaper to send our guys out there than to constantly hire contractors, or we could deploy this solution to access our gear remotely since we have locations all over the globe, but yeah, we need to cut costs alright.



Even if you are the one who solves everything, it doesn't mean you get more say, more direction, or more pay. You just get everyone hitting you up at every hour of the day to do things that they could probably figured out if they bothered to learn how to use google.

Can you also actually run it and see if it works (try decrypting or encrypting a drive. If you get ""CLASS OBJECT NOT RECOGNISED"" then please let me know). 

# Full description

So I'm curious to see if there's a way to resolve this one that I haven't thought of.

Windows on ARM device; Galaxy Book 4 Edge. Had one around as a test device to see when they'll be ready to deploy and support.

Forced the 25H2 update on it by mounting the ISO and upgrading. Did this to get the ADMX files to prepare for. Installed and rebooted.

After rebooting, it threw me into the Bitlocker recovery screen. **I have the recovery code on AD.** Press Windows key to continue, Windows key doesn't work - odd. Rebooted. Nope, Windows key still doesn't work. Weirdly Ctrl Alt Delete reboots as expected though and F8 or F10 flash the screen briefly, but the Windows key? No response.

External keyboard, exact same behavior, including with Ctrl Alt Del and F8 / F10. 

Read about `manage-bde` so I figured make a WinPE image, grab the WIM from Windows on ARM, pull out the `manage-bde` file and `en-US` folder and slap in on the WinPE USB, then decrypt the drive. It seems like `manage-bde` isn't compiled for ARM? I get ""CLASS OBJECT NOT RECOGNISED"" which looks to be a C++ error relating to not finding the necessary dependencies for the architecture (not a developer so I'm probably talking shit here). Weirdly though I can query the `manage-bde` with /? and have it say the syntax is incorrect so it's not completely unreadable but... Yeah.

Thought I'd pull the SSD from the laptop and decrypt it on another machine. Turns out the SSD is soldered on so that's not an option.

Thought I'd load up the ISO on Rufus, and set up a Windows to Go image, loading that gets to the Windows loading screen, but then leads to a crash screen saying `INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE`. Further reading [lead me to this](https://superuser.com/questions/1718225/inaccessible-boot-device-in-windows-when-booting-from-usb)

That's when it all started to make sense. 

The USB drives are all USB 4.0. The keyboard is evidently going through the USB 4.0 bus and not a separate 2.0 one like most others (WTF Samsung). 

The keyboard isn't working because the USB 4.0 drivers are simply not being loaded during these recovery screens (WTF Microsoft). 

I tried copying the SYSTEM hive on the USB to my computer to try and set that registry key, but I'm not seeing it ""HardwareConfig"" so I don't think it's an option.

Linux on these Snapdragon laptops and specifically the Galaxy Book 4 Edge is currently unbootable.

I know I can just format, but there have been definitely instances over the years on other PC's at our org where the TPM misbehaves, needing the recovery key during boot, and it seems like with these laptops this means going through [a convoluted complete format process involving 2 USBs](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1f9k3h5/my_experience_so_far_with_a_windows_arm_device/) as well as complete loss of data, which is enough for me to write off the idea of putting these into production for the foreseeable future and is a massive shame. 

I don't suppose anyone here has ideas that I haven't thought of to at the very least access the drive to retrieve data (and maybe decrypt it?). The laptop doesn't seem to have any kind of ""external hard drive mode"" like the Macs do unfortunately. I also don't understand why I'm able to boot into WinPE but not Windows to Go.

nhjmtpw,Tech,sysadmin,"nan Windows isn’t legacy technology, so I’m not sure where you got that idea from.  There are many orgs that aside from things like O365, G-Suite, and other SaaS applications don’t leverage “the cloud” or Linux.

Then there are many orgs who use Azure or AWS to host their Windows servers.

Organizations use what works best for their business and their wallet.

That is bad, very bad.  Users should not have local admin rights or passwords.  All local Windows admin passwords should be managed by LAPS.

Weird, no. Horribly bad, yes.  That makes it super easy for an attacker to move laterally within your environment.  All local Windows passwords should be managed by LAPS.

Do you mean there are no firewalls between vlans in your environment?  If it is small enough I can see this happening, but it is still not great.

>-customer databases are accessible too

Probably not great, but I don't know enough about the business to really judge.

>most of our servers run on Windows Server 2008 and it’s a nightmare (reboots, etc) 

This is really, really bad.  Windows 2008 is way past EOL, even 2008 R2 is past EOL.  Every one of those servers is a huge security risk.

>the global admin passwords are all more of the same

Again, that makes lateral movement very easy for malicious attackers.  All local Windows passwords should be managed by LAPS with access restricted to a specific group of admins who need it.

>there’s only one backup ?

One backup?  Do you mean each system only has one backup? or backups are only stored in one place?

>-we use Jira as a ticketing system and I just hate it (+no users really uses it and prefer to come directly at our desk or send a teams) 

I have never used Jira as a ticketing system, but if your users are not using your ticketing system it is worthless.

>So yeah, that’s all for now that I could think of. And it seems strange. I know I have almost no experience in this field but I feel that this is not a normal situation. And it puts me in a lot of stress and I am so so tired already. 

It is not a normal situation, there is so much wrong there you would need to prioritize a list of things to fix, starting with the security risks.  Honestly, I doubt that your bosses are going to be willing to pay the money required to bring the environment up to date.  

>What’s your opinions ? should I just run and find somewhere else to learn the job ? 

You seem smart enough to recognize the problems, document them and raise your concerns with the other sysadmin and your bosses.  If they are unwilling to address the problems and you can find another place to complete your work-study, run.

nhir5ld,Tech,sysadmin,"nan One thing I've always found frustrating about the industry and has burned me out multiple times, isn't doing the work, or having to learn a new skill, it's the HR r/recruitinghell bullshit that comes along with it when you're in-between jobs.  

You need to be able to learn fast.  Very little of the tech stack that was popular when I started my career is even in use anymore.   There are new frameworks every year. 

But when it comes time to hire, these HR clowns assume, you'll never be able to learn a new tech stack, even though after 20 years in IT, you've already learned multiple tech stacks over the years. 

Just because I was still dealing with an AS/400 for our ERP system at our last job, doesn't mean I can't learn a new tech stack.  Because I had never used AS/400 prior to my last job.  

I was interviewing at a place that used Citrix for their VDI.   They told me they wanted someone with more Citrix experience.   But I already had experience with VMware Horizen and AWS WorkSpaces.   I'd figure out Citrix.

fwiw, I am an elder geek and a grey beard. young people will be grey beards too. no stopping it. grey beards have a lot of value, wisdom, and experience. yes, our brain acuity peaked in our younger years. but there's much we still have to give, presuming we are staying up to date and on the edge of tech.

I dunno if I'm just burnt out short term or I'm done and just burnt from the industry. I would love your honest opinion on if I need to just ditch the industry or if I just need to take a break.

History:

I've worked from Service Monkey reading off scripts over the phone to SysAdmin (for want of a better term on both of those) over 12 years. I've worked in MSP and Internal, supported companies as small as 5 up to 10,000+ headcounts. Doing Networking, Private Cloud, Public Cloud, Kubernetes, API integrations and anything else thrown at me. I loved my work, I was good at it, it was my career, hobby, special interest and at times my whole life (that wasn't healthy). I'm bad at controlling myself and burnt out many times over the years being signed off for 3-6 months. My reputation was enough to have a free offer years later to rejoin the places I bailed out of after a burnout period.

Recent: 

Over the last 5 years I've worked in 3 companies and I feel everything's just gone downhill.  

1: A MSP Start-Up where I was given a high value small headcount company. Initially just a project work for the client, leading to the client contract having dedicated me. After full migration (cloud, saas, mdm, laptop refresh etc) I had nothing to do, MSP wouldn't risk the client to move me so I left. (I was spending less than 1/8 of my shift doing work)  

2: I worked at a major events company, their setup was shocking, 0 industry standards awareness let alone following, live systems that were running and nobody had admin to. Initially loved it blind to the lack of organization as that meant I could make big changes quick. Later, having done all I really could without funding hit a brick wall and the arguments with Finance lead to me burning out for 6 months and quitting

3: Finally an internal job with 1500 headcount generic company, I was hired to focus on monitoring solutions and cloud renewal from click ops into IaC. Day one I log onto monitoring there's over 1000 live critical alerts (mostly noise). Fix the monitoring but still nobody trusts it, IaC projects get scrapped after a change of board decided to reallocate the funds assigned to cloud. I'm left begging people to take my monitoring alerts seriously and in an circle of me going X system needs Y doing, get ignored until the major incident I warned of happens. 



For 12 years I've enjoyed what I do, I take pride in my work. Now I look at my projects and they are bare minimum acceptable, I don't bother reading tech news, I don't do home labs anymore, I hate logging on. I feel like when I raise the issues I sound like the engineers I use to hate. Here's a list of 20 things we're doing wrong with 0 solutions proposed. 

Conclusion and Questions:

I don't know if I can just blame shit company or if I'm just fully burnt from the industry. I feel something wrong but it's not like before where I completely burn out and am incapable of doing anything. I'm capable I just don't give a fuck / don't see the point.

Financially I'm good, I can survive for 2+ years without working again, (I'm lucky there.) But I honestly don't know where I am: 

Am I just burnt out and need a break and I've just never caught myself before it's become catastrophic?

Or am I just done and burnt from the industry and need to look to retrain into something else that won't make me hate the daily grind?

1nwclnp,Tech,sysadmin,"RANT - SAT Testing  - Ridiculously poor programming So the company is responsible for College students' standard testing can't even write a proper testing app on ChromeOS.

I was tasked with figuring out why random Chromebooks were hanging with a WiFi Network error when opening the RedBook App (Used for SAT testing). Some machines worked perfectly, and others did not. The app runs in Kiosk mode, so once you launch the app, you can not see the Wi-Fi status or change any system settings until you reboot. I tried capturing traffic, checking firewall rules, os version, etc. 

When I looked at the installation directions, they mention that to avoid file corruption, you must, during the first startup, wait a few minutes after launching the app, or you will basically brick the app. Their fix is to powerwash the Chromebook. For those of you who are lucky enough not to have to deal with Chromebooks, Powerashing deletes all the profiles and reinstalls the os.

\- Defender XDR shines when you also run Defender for Office 365 and Defender for Identity-nice cross‑domain incidents and decent automated investigation. Plan some time to tune noise. Patch story relies on Intune/SCCM and winget; no built‑in third‑party patch like GZ.

1nwy913,Tech,msp,"Structuring MSP business Hello everyone,

We are a small MSP with seven technical employees. We are currently experiencing strong growth with many new customers.

We currently have an ERP system for quotes, orders, invoices, etc., which is linked to a ticket system. This allows us to bill efficiently and keeps administrative costs very low.

We document customer environments in Hudu. In Hudu, we make extensive use of the KB function and processes. We have broken down many tasks into processes and have guides for many tasks such as migrations.

We have now reached a capacity limit, which lies in the handover of projects to technical staff. Currently, we do this as follows:



\- As CEO/project manager, I perform an infrastructure analysis at the customer's site. Depending on the size of the customer, I spend hours/days at the customer's site and record the entire environment.

\- I then work out the analysis and the sales department uses it to create a quote.

\- The sales department has sold a project, e.g., the migration of an on-premises Exchange Server to Exchange Online with new end devices, a new firewall, migration from the file server to SharePoint, etc.

\- As CEO/project manager, I then create a kind of runbook/playbook in One Note based on templates: To do this, I create a section for each project/order and, within that section, pages for parts such as migration to Exchange Online, replacement of end devices, firewall setup, migration from file server to SharePoint, etc. (i.e., everything that was sold in the project).

\- I then record any special features and instructions for the technician on what exactly needs to be done on the pages.

\- The pages contain templates for things like migration to Exchange Online for questions such as which shared mailboxes are available and who has access to them. Read-only or send?

\- The OneNote section therefore contains detailed information on everything the technician needs to do.

\- I then hold a kick-off meeting with the technician who is carrying out the project, and then he gets started.



The whole process with OneNote seems too unprofessional and too slow to me. 

In Hudu, I can't create the runbooks/playbooks I need; Hudu isn't designed for that.

How do larger MSPs do it? How does the handover process work here? Especially the detailed briefing of the technician who is to carry out the project?

nhk05is,Tech,msp,"nan Honestly this is severely messed up.  You need a project management software.  We use Jira.  You build baseline projects with tasks and subtasks and everything then tweak them to fit the individual project needs then deploy.  It splits the huge project into multiple subtasks and lets you assign them to various teams, add blockers and manage the entire workflow.      You can Kanban or Gnatt or whatever all the tasks and display on wallboards or anything else.     

Projects can be small tickets that take 5 minutes or huge projects that are over years and thousands of subtasks.   You then can have unlimited projects and teams and members and you just adjust the filters to show whatever you want, and permissions to block others from seeing what you don't.  Scales from 1 employee to hundreds of thousands.  Tons of integrations

People handle their task and close or reassign to someone else, all with notes.  Everything is tracked, logged and all comments are included.  You deliver the project, handle the final tasks then close the project and now have it all bundled. 

To your last point, this is exactly why the project management software is important.  You have a full log of everything and tasks with checkboxes, notes, instructions or whatever.  You're able to hold employees accountable and track their status.  Also they can add their own subtasks, reassign and add blockers so if they have any questions or issues it sends to you.    On top of this you have capacity planning and allow the techs to allocate their resources.  Silicon Valley scene really shows how Scrum works and is a baseline of Jira.

Well, for starters, then they need to stop using windows. Get on chromebooks and use google management. But more importantly:

You are the IT pro, you should be dictating what solutions you deploy and support. If you're just selling support hours, that's not MSP work, that's just subcontracted labor.

If it doesn't work well or isn't secure, that's not an issue for you, because they built it. If a client architects a crappy house and you build it how they said, that's on them if the layout ends up sucking.

Of course, they'll go ""well no, we don't know how, that's what we pay you for"". Which to them means for you to spend dozens of unpaid hours building and testing something one-off for only them.

nhe1cf7,Tech,msp,"nan > , but it does more like encryption and web filtering, so others will use S1, then add an encryption tool, then add a web filtering tool, and all of those combined was same resource as Sophos endpoint.

They re-wrote the endpoint agent a couple times, and it's not slower anymore, and i feel does a lot for it's weight.

Some of my beef with Sophos is what you say. All it does for encryption is manage Bitlocker, the same way rmm, or Intune, or ad does. So why do i have to pay more for it to just set some registry keys? So we've taken that out of Sophos.

Same for web filtering...that's included, so why is DNS filtering MORE? DNS filtering is to web filtering like EDR is to basic AV, it's web filtering and some other features. IMHO, especially for their endpoint price, they should merge web filtering and dns filtering and merge them into endpoint at no additional cost. We have to run DNS filtering on top of sophos anyway to cover some gaps and check some boxes.  Their MDM is decent and, imho, worth the cost they charge.

But, if you're clients are mainly bus prem? encryption, mdm (and you could argue web filtering) is done just as well (in some ways better, some ways worse), there. Endpoint can be there too. So rather than huntress + sophos +dns filtering agent, we can do huntress + MDE + dns filtering at a better price point and, IMHO, a better protection level.

You can of course run sophos all in and no huntress which changes things. We don't see endpoint infections very often but we had a nasty, bad, live one. Sophos just reported it blocked a file and moved on. This was on a full MDR licensed and managed machine. Huntress lit up, isolated, and detailed 100 powershell and other process sophos totally missed or didn't care about. No call from sophos SOC/MDR. I felt let down.

Still though, as a comprehensive ecosystem?

1nusxxf,Tech,msp,"Low Verizon Upload Speeds on Enterprise Equipment only on Wi-Fi **!!!!SOLVED!!!!!** The issue was 2 bad Meraki switches in a row. I am not sure if they were just not compatible with Verizon/bad firmware or bad hardware but we're getting full upload speeds on Wi-Fi now on the 3rd switch (Calayst 9300).

It used to be 400 mbps down and 30 mbps up at the most and now we're getting near symmetrical speeds (400 mbps down/400 mbps up).

Hi All,

We have been working with a client of ours to resolve a wireless upload issue that has been plaguing them for a few months. I am making this post to see if anyone has seen an issue like this before as Meraki Support has not been helpful at all even uploading all of the logs that they requested for.

**Problem**

Low upload speeds (30 Mbps) on Wi-Fi (Guest or Internal) when using the Verizon Circuit on Meraki/Palo Alto hardware when testing using various laptops (Surfaces/Lenovo X1/Dell XPS) in the office and mobile phones.

**Goal**

Figure out what is causing the low upload speeds on Wi-Fi and try to achieve upload speeds that are within the 100 – 300 Mbps range.

**Questions**

1. What could be causing the Verizon (Primary Circuit) to have low upload speeds when using Wi-Fi even though the download speeds are amazing?
2. Are there any specific settings/logs that we should look into that may be impacting the upload speeds?

**Notes**

* **Verizon Business Plan (Speeds):** 930 Mbps (Download)/930 Mbps (Upload) when testing using an Ethernet connection.
* **AP Mounting Style**: Mounted using the provided Cisco gear on top of the ceiling.
* **Office Size:** Very small office space with all of the (3) APs in near proximity. Most employees are within 30-50 ft of an access point.
* **Cable drop:** Leveraging CAT5E cable drops that feed into the patch panel.
* **PCs:** Most of the PCs are Surfaces/Lenovo X1's or Dell XPS with a mixture of Wi-Fi chips from Qualcomm/Broadcom/Intel
* **Timing:** There is no specific time during the day of the week where the speeds are better or worse for uploads. The upload speeds are consistently terrible.
* **Verizon:** We've called Verizon, and they said that the issue is on our side and not their equipment/infrastructure.
* **Duplex:** We've checked and there are no issues with Duplex.
* **Switch Power:** We've checked and no issues with low power on switch port(s) of the APs.

**Hardware**

**1.      Switches**

**A.     Original Switch:** Meraki MS130-24X

* This was experiencing issues with the upload speeds hovering around the 5 Mbps range even when plugging a PC directly into the Switch using the ethernet cable.
* Discussed with Meraki and it was a known issue with the hardware/firmware for this model of the Switch. Afterwards, it was replaced with a Meraki MS150-24P-4G.

**B.     New Switch #1:** Meraki MS150-24P-4G

* This new switch solved the issue with the low upload speeds with a PC plugged directly into the switch (5 Mbps to 900 Mbps+)
* However, the issue remains with the Wi-Fi only hovering around the 30 Mbps range and not going beyond that limitation even with the Radio frequencies adjusted/power not being throttled/and no band steering.

**C.    New Switch #2:** Cisco Catalyst 9300

* New switch that we are planning to utilize to replace the Meraki MS150-24P-4G to see if it would resolve the upload speed issues on wireless.
* Unsure if it is a bad batch of Meraki switches causing our low upload speed issues.

**2.      Firewall:** Both PA firewalls setup in Active/Passive setup.

**A.     PA440-01:** Primary

**B.     PA440-02:** Secondary

**3.      Access Points**

**A.     Current AP:** Meraki CW9172I

* We have (3) of these in the office that are being utilized.
* This has been the original AP since day (1) when the new office setup was built out.
* Has always been experiencing issues with upload speeds.
* Firmware version is on MR 31.1.8
* Firmware was previously upgraded and also downgraded with no impact on Upload speeds

**B.     Spare AP:** Meraki MR44

* New spare AP that we are utilizing to see if the upload speed issue is isolated to the CW9172I.
* New spare AP still has the same low upload speed issue on Wi-Fi even on Guest/Internal and 6 Ghz network.

**Observations**

**A.     Firmware**

**a. Meraki Switch:** Firmware has been updated to the latest version.

**b. Meraki Access Points:** Firmware has been updated to the latest version.

 

**B.     Ethernet**

**1. Verizon ONT to PC:** No issues when hard wiring Verizon ONT directly to the PC via the ethernet port.

* **Note:** Upload speeds are nearly symmetrical with download speeds.

**2. Meraki Switch to PC:** No issues when hard wiring the PC to an open switch port using Verizon as the primary circuit.

* **Note:** Upload speeds are nearly symmetrical with download speeds.  

**C.    Wireless**

**a. Verizon**

**1. Meraki Access Point to Switch:** When connecting the Meraki Access point directly into the Switch using a brand new CAT6 ethernet cable, and performing a Wi-Fi speed test, the upload speed is around 30 Mbps.

**2. Single Meraki Access Point:** When disconnecting all Meraki Access Points except for (1) and plugging the individual AP into the switch, the upload speeds are around 30 Mbps.

**3. 6 Ghz Network:** When enabling the 6 Ghz frequency on the Meraki switch and testing with a Samsung S23+ and a Lenovo X1 P16, the upload speeds are still around 30 Mbps

**4. Guest and Internal SSID:** When testing the connection using both the Internal and Guest wireless networks, the upload speeds are still around 30 Mbps.

 **b. Comcast (Secondary ISP)**

* **Wireless Speed Test (Guest/Internal):** Comcast speed tests performed on wireless and guest are around 40 – 50 Mbps, which is expected as Comcast is not asymmetrical.",['firewall'],low verizon

1nu81l3,Tech,msp,"Tooling stack for a growing MSP / IT-business Hello,

First of all, please excuse the lengthy post 😅.

**TL;DR:**  
I'm looking for some input on the tooling stack we're currently using, and I would love to hear about people’s experiences in this community. I’m aware there have probably been similar posts before. However, most of those discussions tend to focus on comparisons between tool X and tool Y, and rarely consider the overall bigger picture.

\-

Some context about our business. We’re based in Europe (Benelux region) with a team of around 20 people. Over the years we've branched out in some other (related) fields and offer more services than your traditional MSP. Our team consists of system engineers, network engineers, business analysts, developers, and a management team. Our clients range from 10 to 500 users. Some are fully managed by us, while for others, we act as a backup for their internal IT teams or handle only the more complex implementations.

We’ve been operating for 10 years and are actively re-evaluating all of our current tooling. As our business continues to grow, we want to ensure that our tooling stack is scalable and suitable for all our departments in the coming years.

The main things we currently use are:

**ConnectWise Manage (cloud-hosted)**  
Our PSA solution. We're currently using this specifically for service and project management. When we first started, we also used most of the other modules, but they were too limited for our needs and simply not suitable for the region/market we're in.

**ConnectWise Automate (self-hosted)**  
Our RMM solution for servers and workstations. We've built many custom monitors, scripts, and automations over the year, ranging from simple tasks to more complex workflows. Anything that can't be fully automated is sent to Manage as a service ticket to be reviewed.

**Auvik**  
We use this solely for network monitoring and for creating tickets about network devices in Manage.

**ITGlue**  
Our documentation platform. We currently rely on the configuration and contact sync from Manage. We've also built quite a few custom flexible assets over the years, which we’re increasingly populating through automations via Rewst.

**Rewst**  
Originally, we mostly relied on native integrations between tools. However, some of them were lacking or non-existent. We now use Rewst to build our own integrations via API, as well as to automate as many processes as possible that would otherwise be tedious chores for technicians or the sales team.

**Odoo**  
Our ERP system, which we also implement for clients. We’re not looking to change this. It’s mainly used to cover areas where Manage falls short, such as quotes, subscriptions, and invoicing. Beyond that, we also use it for various other business needs. For example, CRM, HR, car park management, contracts, ... We’ve considered using it for service and project management as well, but we’re not fully convinced by the current version. Doing this would require us to build customizations and integrations with Automate and Auvik via Rewst.

**Backup Radar**  
We use this to keep track of all client backups, regardless of the solution used. Although this is mostly Veeam, with some custom tracking for things like HPE storage-level snapshots, and so on.

**BrightGauge**  
We’ve been using this since before it was acquired by ConnectWise. It’s mostly used for monthly reports sent out to clients. A lot of our gauges rely on filters such as serviceboard, status, priority and type/subtype/item (which are present on every ticket in Manage).

**Power BI**  
Similar to BrightGauge, but at the moment mostly using this for internal dashboards and reports. Eventually, we're looking to replace BrightGauge completely by replacing the monhtly reports with dashboards that are accessible through a customer portal.

**Other tools:**  
\- MS365 and basically anything MS has to offer.  
\- Mimecast (e-mail security)  
\- Bitdefender GravityZone (AV/EDR)  
\- Keeper (password mgr)  
\- Cisco Duo (MFA)  
\- Snipe-IT (asset management)  
\- Phished

Overall, we've been pretty happy with the tools we've used for years. Although there are some concerns and we're evaluating if we should make changes in some areas. In our opinion there are two possible approaches, and we more or less have the resources to do either:

**Option A**  
Stay with Connectwise or a similar vendor that offers a variety of tools to cover most of the needs and has native integrations. Fill all the gaps with other tools and use Rewst to integrate them via API.

**Option B**  
Select a variety of tools that are the best in their own areas and try to avoid as much overlap as possible to make sure licensing costs make sense. Use native integrations if they are vailable, otherwise just build them ourselves via Rewst.

**Our biggest pain points at the moment:**

\- The licensing cost for CW Manage is quite high, especially considering we’re now only using it for service and project management. Everything is slowly being migrated to Asio, but based on what we’ve seen so far, we’re not convinced. Project management capabilities are also very limited at the moment, and tracking multiple projects running simultaneously is a real challenge. Additionally, a solid client-facing ticketing portal is non-existent.

\- ITGlue serves its purpose, and we’re able to automate the population of flexible assets from a variety of other tools. However, the collaboration aspect with clients is lacking in many areas, and we’re also missing features related to ISO and legal compliance.

\- Migrating to different tools would obviously require significant effort. The most intensive migration would likely be Automate, given how much custom functionality we’ve built over the years.

If you’re an MSP, you already know this:

❌ Managing backups shouldn’t be a time sink or a guessing game.

❌ You can’t grow your business using unreliable backup software.

❌ And you definitely shouldn’t have to choose between affordability and features when protecting your clients.

➡️ That’s where **NAKIVO Backup & Replication** flips the script.

✅ Designed with MSPs in mind, NAKIVO gives you a single pane of glass to manage **all your client backups** — VMware, Hyper-V, Proxmox, Windows/Linux servers, Microsoft 365, AWS EC2 — you name it.

✅ Multi-tenant architecture built in. Full isolation between clients, role-based access, and **brandable portals** so you stay in control.

✅ MSP-friendly licensing — **monthly subscription model**, scale up or down depending on your client base. You don’t pay for what you don’t need.

✅ Immutable backups, ransomware protection, instant VM recovery, file-level recovery — all the enterprise-grade features your clients want (without them having to pay enterprise rates).

💥 You’re not in this business to micromanage backups or babysit failed jobs. You’re here to scale, serve, and keep your clients protected without drama.

nglc6mg,Tech,msp,"nan The *only* use case I can see for this is pre-joining workstations to an on-prem domain, and the use case for that in 2025 is pretty damn narrow. Basically only if you've got a long and manual workstation build, probably several of them. We have, a handful of times, pulled out a spare firewall and spun up a temporary site-to-site connection so that we could build out a multi-PC deployment of multiple workstations that require a long setup time (don't remember if it was CAD or an accounting firm that needed several parallel installs of Lacerte and QuickBooks).

1nuxiyp,Tech,talesfromtechsupport,"That time I had to SSH into a Roomba to fix a VPN issue It’s been a while since I posted a story, but this one came up in conversation the other day and I figured it was worth sharing.

Back during Covid, when everyone was working remotely, I had an issue escalated to me from our helpdesk.  
They’d already gone through the usual steps — repairing the connection, reinstalling the client, testing other credentials — but nothing worked. The user would hit *connect*, enter their password, and the moment it connected, it would immediately disconnect.

Now, I’ve learned not to blindly trust “I already tried that” because I’ve been burned before when someone skipped the less-obvious step. So, I started checking things myself.

Some background: a few of our older clients had set up their own networks before we came on board. Normally, when we take over, we standardize things — readdress the network, VLAN off cameras and guest Wi-Fi, that sort of thing. But this particular client never went through that process. Their office at the time was literally just a converted residential house, with desks in every room.  
That meant their office network was still on 192.168.1.x — the same subnet as the user’s home network.

I ran an IP scan and noticed a device on [192.168.1.254](http://192.168.1.254), which happened to be the same address as their office firewall. So the moment the VPN connected, traffic defaulted to the local device instead of tunneling through, and the connection dropped.

The device didn’t have a web interface, and a MAC lookup just came back as some generic manufacturer. But it did respond on Telnet and SSH. After some questioning, we figured out what it was: their robot vacuum cleaner that the user’s husband had set up. Apparently, you’re only supposed to manage it through the app, which explained the lack of a web interface.

I ended up finding default credentials online, SSH’ing into the thing, and readdressing it to resolve the issue.

To this day, I still enjoy watching people’s expressions when I ask:  
“Did I ever tell you about the time I had to SSH into a Roomba to fix a VPN issue?”

**TL;DR:**  
When you onboard a client, push harder to change their office network so it’s not sitting on the default subnet.

  
Edit:

For the sake of clarification. It wasn't a Roomba but some other branded robot vacuum cleaner. A detail that felt overall unnecessary but 1 or 2 people seemed hung up on.

Few people asked why not readdress the firewall.  
Well yes that's the ideal scenario but to change the IP address of the office firewall in the middle of the day to fix a conflict caused by the users home network seemed unnecessary.

nhh3n82,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"nan OP please listen to this. I’ve been in IT on and off for 20 years, and cybersecurity DevOps/SRE for the last 10 years. Here’s what you gotta do in that situation: Say, “Oh it’s really just a buzz word? Okay, well thank you for the advice! I’d love to know more about what you need help with here, because really above everything, I just want to contribute meaningfully to the team.”

Meanwhile, continue spending your free time studying cybersecurity. Bringing it up again will not help you.

When your employment is the foundation for funding the rest of your life, you need to look out for yourself. As soon as you feel confident you can make at least 20-30% more somewhere else, go do that. Leave and don’t look back.

Of course, don’t burn bridges. Be the guy/gal people like working with. Referrals and networking are key in this industry.

If you’ve been at a company for 3 years, and you feel you aren’t learning much and you certainly aren’t getting good raises every year, leave ASAP for 20-30% more.

Skilling up in this industry is a combination of experience and drive. If you are both driven and have the opportunity to do new things all the time, you will gain the skills to make more money.

Money is *not* everything, of course. But the more senior you are in terms of title and skill level, the better your work/life balance.

October 2015 I started in a SOC answering calls for enterprise firewall support. Shifts were 9 hours with an unpaid lunch, and my commute was minimum 30 minutes, so I was out of the home 10 hours a day. On call sucked, and we had a nights and weekends rotation too. I made $45k/yr.

Ten years later, I do SRE/DevOps for a cyber security company, work from home 100%, work 10am-5pm every weekday, and I make $175k/yr plus 10% annual bonus.

In those ten years, I skilled up from homelabbing and learning at work as well. I also changed jobs 3 times (on my fourth job since 2015 now).

It takes initiative, but I truly believe that if someone has the passion for this work, and if you are willing to take risks by leaving a good-enough job for a total unknown that pays more, one can rise quickly through the ranks.

Some tips:

- When interviewing and asked what you make currently, say, “I’d prefer not to discuss that. I am asking for $xxx,xxx because I believe my experience and skills warrant that in the current market.”

- When negotiating your salary, tell them you are actually about to get your annual bonus at your current employer, so would the new employer please offer a signing bonus to compensate for the loss of that annual bonus this year? I’ve scored 2 signing bonuses this way. And I was telling the truth too. First signing bonus was $4k on a $110 salary and the second was $10k on a $155k salary.

- Do not ruffle feathers or antagonize your colleagues. Be seen as dependable, honest, earnest, and politically neutral. Every gig has weird political stuff going on between various groups or individuals. Try to stay out of it if you can.

- Everyone has imposter syndrome. I have it every day. Expect it. Don’t let it bring you down. Just keep chugging away at the new, difficult stuff you are learning until you feel comfortable and confident with the new skill. What I like do when conquering a new, formidable task, is add documentation to it as I go, which reinforces the knowledge.",['firewall'],op please listen to this ive been in it on and off for years and cybersecurity devopssre for the last years heres what you gotta do in that situation say oh its really just a buzz word okay well thank you for the advice id love to know more about what you need help with here because really above everything i just want to contribute meaningfully to the team meanwhile continue spending your free time studying cybersecurity bringing it up again will not help you when your employment is the foundation for funding the rest of your life you need to look out for yourself as soon as you feel confident you can make at least more somewhere else go do that leave and dont look back of course dont burn bridges be the guygal people like working with referrals and networking are key in this industry if youve been at a company for years and you feel you arent learning much and you certainly arent getting good raises every year leave asap for more skilling up in this industry is a combination of experience and drive if you are both driven and have the opportunity to do new things all the time you will gain the skills to make more money money is not everything of course but the more senior you are in terms of title and skill level the better your worklife balance october i started in a soc answering calls for enterprise firewall support shifts were hours with an unpaid lunch and my commute was minimum minutes so i was out of the home hours a day on call sucked and we had a nights and weekends rotation too i made kyr ten years later i do sredevops for a cyber security company work from home work ampm every weekday and i make kyr plus annual bonus in those ten years i skilled up from homelabbing and learning at work as well i also changed jobs times on my fourth job since now it takes initiative but i truly believe that if someone has the passion for this work and if you are willing to take risks by leaving a goodenough job for a total unknown that pays more one can rise quickly through the ranks some tips when interviewing and asked what you make currently say id prefer not to discuss that i am asking for xxxxxx because i believe my experience and skills warrant that in the current market when negotiating your salary tell them you are actually about to get your annual bonus at your current employer so would the new employer please offer a signing bonus to compensate for the loss of that annual bonus this year ive scored signing bonuses this way and i was telling the truth too first signing bonus was k on a salary and the second was k on a k salary do not ruffle feathers or antagonize your colleagues be seen as dependable honest earnest and politically neutral every gig has weird political stuff going on between various groups or individuals try to stay out of it if you can everyone has imposter syndrome i have it every day expect it dont let it bring you down just keep chugging away at the new difficult stuff you are learning until you feel comfortable and confident with the new skill what i like do when conquering a new formidable task is add documentation to it as i go which reinforces the knowledge,positive

nhfhsjb,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"nan To answer your question:

Yes, there is high competition for tier 1 and 2 helpdesk / desktop support roles. These are low-skill jobs that don't require more than a year of experience. Having 10 years of experience in desktop support, as someone else mentioned, isn't appealing. After about 4 years of desktop support, you're just not picking up new things at the same rate or getting exposure to new technology. So why would they choose someone with more experience than they need who wants more pay than they want to pay? And even if it wasn't a pay issue, like others have said, a long time in a lower-level role actually LOWERS your value. It demonstrates a lack of ability to grow.

And then to ask you some questions (with no rudeness intended):

I have NEVER heard of ""I didn't want to advance and make nearly double per year in a higher-level role.""

Is it that you genuinely don't like Sysadmin, or that you don't feel comfortable with it because of your level of technical understanding? Can you perform the work of a Sysadmin...? I remember being in a T2 desktop role. I had a decent understanding of active directory and I could troubleshoot GPO conflicts, DNS issues and computer object account issues, but I wouldn't have been able to perform a domain migration or functional domain upgrade.

1nw4gl2,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"What position am I looking for? Hello all,
Currently I feel that I'm at a crossroads in my career. I have around six years of IT experience, from supporting 20k users in a hospital setting, to glorified help desk (""Desktop Engineer"") for 120 users in FinTech / PE.
I have a generic BS in IT from WGU with all the certs that comes with it, I tinker with a homelab on my spare time, and I have a will to learn more.
I realized that I enjoy  backend work, like setting up a new SharePoint hub and sites, give users specific access to what they need. Automate things to make processes easier like onboarding or creating several PDL for different teams, leading a project to move users home drives from the network to Onedrive, working with Azure and Intune to streamline things.

nhaa26d,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"nan In my experience, I don't think a 4 year CS degree is necessary. I've had many coworkers who were non-CS or even non-STEM. However, I personally benefited from a CS education for a few reasons (in no particular order):

1. Understanding the fundamental aspects of computing like bits and logical operators are helpful in an IT context. For example, learning Linux permission bits, IP octets and subnet masks, and bash scripting all use those concepts. 
2. Learning things like software development helps for scripting and automation and when working in/supporting DevOps contexts. My proficiency in bash scripting was 100% facilitated by knowing how to program, even though programming != scripting. I definitely had an edge over my non-CS colleagues when writing quality scripts faster due to my previous experience with programming fundamentals like conditionals, variables, loops, etc. Also, if you end up supporting software developers in your company, knowing what a software dev stack looks like can be helpful in troubleshooting their issues. 
3. Part of my CS education involved learning Scrum/Kanban/Agile development, which has been used in several of my IT gigs. Being familiar with that project management methodology has been useful in my more infrastructure related roles for interacting with management and planning large projects. 
4. Least importantly these days, having a CS bachelor's checks a box for HR. That alone might be worth something. 
5. Finally, I think having the structure of formal schooling holds me more accountable; I don't think I would have been disciplined enough to self educate in a capacity that would make me hireable.

5 months later, and I am completely lost. My teacher in my first year of tech school wasn't great, and made us independently study for the most of our time. This was hard, as he would never answer questions for the material, and I was always lost in the first place in regards to material and concepts. The only reason I passed the tests were because I forced myself to remember patterns, keywords, and certain neumonics just so I could remember.

>We never worked with servers, active directory, networks, or anything. Every time something related to these concepts gets brought up, I get confused, overwhelmed, and shut down.

Take this as an opportunity to reflect on yourself. What you *did* was change passwords, and replace screens, but you had an opportunity to learn a lot more. Figure out why you got confused and overwhelmed to the point where you shut down. It would have been 1000x better if you figured it out while doing the internship, but figure out what you should do now. Make changes accordingly.

As far as what you learned in class, it doesn't really matter tbh. It will become relevant again once you're working in the field, maybe not all of it, but some should at least. At that point, you'll be able to recall things, and build on them from there. It's normal. School doesn't teach you everything you need to know, just enough to have a good background knowledge, get started and build from. Which is what you had an opportunity to do and should have done during your internship.

Since you for some reason ""shut down"" instead of learning more from your internship, you're now facing a setback. Do some studying in your own time, get more certifications, and keep learning to catch back up. You may succeed, you may not. It depends on how much effort you want to put in, whether you give up, and maybe a little bit of luck now. Lastly, in the future when you face something you're not familiar with, just try to learn about it, don't shut down.

Quick disclosure here, my background consist of IT experience from the Army (25u) with a mixture of Sys Admin and help desk experience. 

As I view the job market and pick out different requirements I’m unsure that anything besides proven work experience will help me progress in this field. 

I’m wrapping up the cloud and network engineering degree from WGU, I got the certs, I’ve gotten my boots wet but I still feel unprepared for anything beyond the help desk. 

I’m curious to know if it’s a realistic expectation to go from the help desk to a network engineer or admin role with help desk experience, the degree and certs. 

Another big thing I’ve noticed is that most companies want you to show up and do. Not many companies seem to have an environment that’s offering mentorship / teachings for people coming into the role. 

Thoughts?

TLDR: I hold the following certs, and soon a BS in Cloud and Network Engineering. Is it a realistic to jump from help desk to a Network / Engineer role with a combination of the 3. Admin/helpdesk experience, the degree and certs?

Needless to say. I’ll get to where I’m going eventually.

1nuex1q,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"15 years in IT (sysadmin → cybersecurity → IT advisor) — not sure what’s next. Should I go back to university or double down on certs? Hi everyone,

I’m at a bit of a crossroads in my career and I’d appreciate some outside perspectives.

I’ve been working in IT for about 15 years.

* Started in IT support in the education sector.
* Moved to SMBs (500–1000 employees) and quickly became a sysadmin.
* Around 2018, I specialized in defensive cybersecurity (picked up several certs).
* Later moved into a team lead / IT manager + security lead role.
* Recently transitioned into an IT advisor / consultant position (better conditions, no people management, more focus on strategy and advisory work).

I’m really a generalist at heart.. I know “1 km wide” of things (sysadmin, networking, cloud, security, etc.), even though I’ve specialized in security in recent years.

Here’s where I’m unsure: what’s the next step?

* I only have a diploma in IT support (2010). I took some university-level IT courses but never completed a degree. My impression is that a university degree is often a requirement for senior management roles... also I’m very introverted and honestly don’t think I’d enjoy the politics that come with those roles.
* I still love IT, I love learning, and I want to keep growing technically.
* I’m torn between:
   1. Going back to university part-time to complete a degree or certificate.
   2. Continuing to build practical skills and pursue in-demand certs, like Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate or Microsoft security tracks.

In my region, almost every organization is all-in on Azure and M365, so that seems like a safe bet.

My goals are:

* Keep learning and staying sharp.
* Strengthen my CV with credentials that give me an edge.
* Future-proof my career in a market that feels a bit shaky right now.

Question: For someone with my background, would you recommend investing in a university degree at this stage, or focusing on practical certs (Azure, security, etc.) to stay relevant?

nh0h5cf,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"nan Junior network engineer is usually a mix of implementing changes, troubleshooting, and documentation. Day-to-day stuff like configuring switches/routers, setting up VLANs, ACLs, basic routing protocols, assisting with firewall rules, cable management, and monitoring network performance. 

You might help with network upgrades, rack and stack equipment, or support senior engineers on bigger projects. Less design work at junior level, more execution of what's already planned. 

Not in networks but studied for it few years ago. For OSPF and BGP, check out Keith Barker's CBT Nuggets videos (if you can access them) or David Bombal's YouTube channel, he's got solid networking content. Jeremy's IT Lab on YouTube is great for hands-on Cisco stuff, too.

Sounds valid to me.  

> Main reason i asked about the books or resources is to get some additional personal input or honestly just to make the decision as i was a bit indecisive.  

Your questions are all valid, it's just the structure of the questions.  

Consider:  

*""I want to be a network engineer, please tell me what to do.""*  

versus:  

*""I want to be a network engineer. I'm thinking about <this> Cisco University free class, and <this> Udemy class. Which should I invest my time in?""*  

One of those two examples is a higher quality question than the other.  
One of those two examples is a better demonstration of your communication skills than the other.

> The critical thinking is there, sometimes, just got a bit discouraged from getting a rejection on my most preferred position/company and ended up sulking here to see whether i'd find something i missed out on.  

Gotta do that whole post-interview reflection / after-action evaluation.  
What did you totally fumble?  
What did you do ok with, but could have improved?  

Each failed interview should make you stronger for the next interview.  

Also: Be sure to reflect upon what questions you asked, or failed to ask of the employer.  

Good questions, even challenging ones show me you are considering us as a long-term employer.  

Ask me what we do for professional development. Ask me about tuition reimbursement.  
Ask me about compensation for on-call obligations.  

We send engineering staff to technology conferences and/or training every year.  
We pay somewhere around $10k a year in tuition reimbursement if you want to grind out a Masters degree.  
We can't wait to tell you about these things because we know other employers in our market region sometimes pay more in base salary, but can't compete with our total investment in staff.

> i really do appreciate your comment, kind of whacked me back into the focus mode i was drifting out of after the rejection mail.  

I did intend it to be a little sharp, a little jarring. But I didn't intend to come across like a total tool. I hope I delivered the right tone.  

Some *unkindness* was intended.  

Your questions, as originally stated suggested you might think the bar you need to jump over might be about waist high.  

The reality is that the bar you need to jump over is about chest-high. You need to aim higher. Plenty of people clear that bar once they put in the right effort.

nh05kxc,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"nan Cloud engineer is quite a few steps above help desk. I went Help Desk to Sysadmin in about a year and then Sysadmin to Jr. Cloud admin in about another year. Then Jr. Cloud Admin to Cloud engineer in another 2 years (skipped the Cloud Admin title but was doing that work about a year in to Jr. Cloud Admin). YMMV a lot here. The company I worked for had a small IT department with no T1, T2, etc. it was either help desk or sysadmin so it was the next move. If you're in a big org there may be several steps in between.

I jumped ship to another company to go from sysadmin > jr. cloud admin as the company I was sysadmin at was small and did not use anything cloud.

I did have my MSIS and AWS Solutions Architect Associate when I was hired at the new company for Jr. Cloud Admin.

nh0as8w,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"nan I did it in just under 3 years. I taught myself powershell scripting and automated several help desk tasks. I was also a high performer on my team and became the go to guy on project tickets since I would make sure to take all the most technically difficult tickets. Two big things that helped me was my company ran very lean with sysadmin type roles so the help desk did a lot of sysadmin tasks. The other was I worked in the same building as the cloud manager, and he was good friends with the help desk manager.

I think a more likely progression would be help desk for a few years then a sysadmin adjacent role for a few years to bridge the gap. I got to skip that as I was doing sysadmin work on the help desk at about a year into the role. 

I would recommend learning a scripting language first. Powershell is good because it will help with your help desk job and it is useful if you go the azure route. Learning a language makes it easier to learn a different languages later on, and if your in the cloud IaC is super easy if you know how to script already.

I’m 30 and for most of my twenties I worked in hospitality. It was a solid experience for building discipline and people skills, but I realized it wasn’t the future I wanted. So in 2024 I went back to school and completed a Cybersecurity diploma this year.

Along the way I also earned certifications like CompTIA Security+, ISC2 CC, Google Cybersecurity, and AWS Cloud Practitioner. Through my program and projects I’ve worked on SIEM monitoring, incident response, vulnerability assessments, and risk management.

The challenge is I don’t have direct IT work experience yet. A lot of entry-level postings still ask for 2–3 years of experience. What I do have is a strong work ethic, communication and teamwork skills, and the determination to keep learning and improving.

Right now I’m trying to figure out my path. Should I aim for a SOC analyst or IT service desk role and grow from there? Should I lean into areas like GRC, security awareness, or technical support that might fit my background better? Or should I keep building certs and try to network my way into an internship or contract just to get started?

A person who struggles to say what they mean but prefers written communication where they can revise until they're content will feel we've got a good collaboration if I will just indulge this preference (and plan for a potentially lengthy back and forth - I may have to always be working on their feature on the back burner just to give enough time for the email thread to reach a conclusion).

10. I can't think of a way to express this because it's not an organized thing I do. I pay attention to people better than me, read news and articles, leverage my communication/relationship skills to get a more distributed and accurate idea of what's important, what's going to come up more, and focus on that. Listen to investor calls and all hands (propaganda) meetings for what they're excited about. Visit this subreddit. Stay in touch with my professional network and go out for drinks once in a while.

11. That DBeaver I mentioned (and I guess Firefox) are open source software. I don't use webapps but in the *spirit* of the question that's important. I'm sure stackexchange, json beautifiers, software documentation, all come in handy.

12. Speaking professionally, I like Visio because it's what I happen to be using when I am feeling satisfaction at work. I feel satisfaction when I save people time or they understand right away, but also when I finish a design, when it all makes sense in a way I've gotten out of my mind and into an articulable shareable document I can point at and say ""see?"". It's probably not that great, I just like it for the wrong reasons. Same for the product I hate, Altova MapForce (for EDI work). We were using it for something we shouldn't have, and that meant a lot of meticulous drudgery and other problems.

13. I do work remotely, at least sometimes (hybrid). During COVID we were full time WFH. It sucks for onboarding, but for a mature team with low turnover it's a great way to work. You have to get comfortable with interrupting and being interrupted because we'll waste a lot of time being polite otherwise. You have to work harder to be socially aware because you lose some tone and body language cues. 

14. People who are dead set on something that isn't the best solution can be hard to dislodge. People who I am meant to serve on the business side who don't effectively reveal requirements even when asked directly are difficult to handle, because I want to satisfy them but they don't understand the process or how their inattention today will result in a poor solution in nine months, making their teams miserable. I overcome this by demonstrating by my actions that I am committed to getting them the best result. I use different words, draw pictures, invent scenarios, and find other ways to explore things from multiple angles to guide the other people through my thought processes as I touch on decision points, their desired outcomes, their risks, etc, so I can get buy in. I yield to interruptions, really encourage them, I try to use the person's own words, framing, and preferred communication style. I ask tangentially related or unrelated questions to gauge their overall preferences or concerns so I can try to tie the perceived value of my project to their own priorities in a way they understand. I guess when we're lacking clear requirements we also follow best practices, including parameterizing instead of hardcoding, and by following those best practices build things in such a way that the distance between what we're building and what they might have preferred is reduced. By considering alternatives and potential future concerns, we can often avoid costly/long-running ""fast follow"" features.

15. Get an internship. It'll help you understand if you like it, and it will be important for your career options. Cyber security, any kind of security, any kind of architecture work, any kind of project leadership or thought leadership in your team, it has to be built on experience. That kind of steering and defending cannot be done before learning to do more routine work. Talk to people about the paths they took to get to the job you want. You can't be like Dr House - those IT guys died out before House MD aired. You can't just be right, and excellent.

1nxcfxx,Tech,cybersecurity,"Learning Terraform in Azure as a Security Admin – Feedback Welcome 
Hey everyone,

Firstly, this is probably shit so bear with me.

I’ve got just over 1 year of experience in security, mainly as a Security Admin in Azure. Recently, I decided to spend some time learning Terraform and applying it to a personal project.

What I did:


	•	Provisioned an Ubuntu VM in Azure using Terraform.


	•	Configured SSH key-based authentication and disabled password logins.


	•	Set up UFW on the VM and an Azure NSG for network-level firewalling.


	•	Installed and configured Nginx, including a self-signed HTTPS certificate.


	•	Used Terraform to manage the NSG and VM provisioning to make the setup reproducible and auditable.


	•	Tested everything incrementally (HTTP → HTTPS, SSH, firewall rules).


I know that from the outside, this probably looks like a pretty basic setup, but my goal was to get hands-on with Terraform while keeping security best practices in mind. I also documented all mistakes I made along the way and how I fixed them—things like:


	•	Getting 403 Forbidden in Nginx because of permissions and index file issues.


	•	Locking myself out with UFW because I didn’t allow SSH first.


	•	Conflicts with multiple server blocks in Nginx.


I’ve pushed the code to GitHub (without any sensitive information, keys, or secrets).

I’d love feedback from anyone experienced in Azure, Terraform, or web security:


	•	What could I do better?


	•	Are there best practices I’m missing?


	•	Any tips for improving Terraform code structure, security hardening, or Nginx configuration?


I know this isn’t a production-ready setup, but my hope is:


	•	To continue learning Terraform in a real cloud environment.


	•	Potentially show something tangible to employers or interviewers.


	•	Get advice from the community on how to improve.


Thanks in advance! Any feedback is welcome.

Splunk is the aging 800 lbs gorilla in the space and I'm not convinced they will be the innovator in this space. Also, creating the detections and investigations on Splunk won't be an easy task. 

I think you've got two viable options: 

1. You can host your own models and build your own agents - if you have the AI/ML expertise and the cycles to build and maintain these. I don't think the average org will have this luxury. 

2. Work with [https://www.cmdzero.io/](https://www.cmdzero.io/) or similar established startups in this space who combine encoded knowledge bases and help you encode your best practices. The fundamental difference between Cmdzero and others in this space is that other startups are taking the easy path by throwing agents at any problem under the sun.

Most of us think of it as just a “network glitch,” but I realized hackers often treat it as a signal — a side-channel that leaks info about OS type, firewall behavior, load, etc.

For example, in a simple ping:

* Intermittent timeouts → could hint at packet filtering or congestion
* TTL values → OS fingerprinting
* Consistent low latency → topology clues

I also explored how attackers might exploit this (DoS amplification, MITM on unstable Wi-Fi, route poisoning) and how defenders can investigate with Wireshark, SIEM, or traceroute correlation.

Proton is basically three things: Wine, DirectX -> Vulkan translation layers (e.g. DXVK), and a Steamworks API bridge so that a Windows version of a game can talk to the Linux Steam client.

The main thing which is missing from Proton is the Steamworks API bridge. At least some of the bridge is open source (as part of Proton), but probably needs some work for Valve to enable in the Mac version of the Steam client. But, most importantly, Apple only lets you use their DirectX -> Metal layer for non-commercial evaluation purposes, so using their stuff for a Mac Proton-like is a no-go.

IMHO the biggest risk in the case of a succession crisis would be an explosion of forks that would diverge away and become irreconcilably incompatible -- each distro already forks their own version of the stable kernels but there is a strong incentive to get things into Linus's tree to avoid the extra maintenance work. I would guess Android would probably be the first to divorce themselves (they already maintain crazy amounts of out-of-tree patches). This would initially suck for a lot of users (some programs would not work on every distro and each project would need to maintain compatibility shims for each distro) but eventually I think there would be a push towards a single tree again (at least for features).

Right now, I am in the process of switching all my devices to Linux Mint.
I have a Synology NAS that I use as photo storage, and it contains a lot of photos.
I tried Winapps and successfully installed Lightroom, Photoshop, and Adobe Bridge to edit and sort my photos (I tested them with locally stored photos).
During my search for a Linux-native replacement for IrfanView (which I use to quickly view photos on the NAS), I came across Nomacs, which seems to be a nice alternative.
So, I thought I had everything I needed to replace all the important native Windows apps.
So far, so good.

**The problem**:
With local folders, Nomacs and all other image viewers I tried are pretty fast. However, when I try to open photos from the NAS, every image viewer either crashes or becomes incredibly slow.
It takes about five minutes just to open a single photo.

The NAS folders are mounted over SMB. I also tried mounting the SMB shares as a folder in my home directory — the mount itself works, and with that, the image viewers that previously couldn’t “see” the SMB shares can now access the photo storage. However, the result is still the same as before.

Does anyone know how to resolve this? Because sadly, this is a showstopper. :-(

I should also mention that I’m using an 8-year-old laptop, but I don’t think that’s the root cause.

nhks4zx,Tech,linux,"nan You have to understand that a business wants certain things that individual users simply don't. If something breaks on your own system, you can maybe open a bug report, try and fix it yourself or just hope. If something breaks for a business, they want contracts, guarantees or service-level agreements with the supplier that they *will* fix it within X hours/days. They want assurance that the people they hire or bring in are accredited with an industry standard certification and they want that to be common enough that they don't have to pay top wages to find someone.

It's for all of those reasons and more that *even if* the value or quality proposition could be successfully argued to change to FOSS alternatives, it's incredibly difficult to pass that final hurdle. Who are you going to pay to get a critical bug fixed *within 24 hours* for LibreOffice sheets for example? If they or a third-party cannot provide that service, it's really hard to recommend. There are projects and companies that offer very good paid support in the Linux ecosystem but it's going to fragment your agreements and going from one really easy to account contract directly with Microsoft to 30 individual agreements with sub-providers is not appetizing.

As for old hardware... Realistically the businesses the size you're thinking of, it's a rounding error. MS mandating a certain age of equipment ties into the above point.

1nv63ji,Tech,linux,"The reason so many Linux users spend years distro hopping You'll never find the perfect distro. You'll distro hop forever because every couple of years a new one emerge, but it will be still be a derivative of  Debian, RH, Arch, Gentoo, or Slackware.  

Instead of looking for the right distro, find the community that is the best fit for you, and you'll stop distro hopping.

My first distro was RH 8.0, only because the CD-ROM came with the book I bought to learn what Linux was all about. 6 or 8 months later I decided to try a different system. At that time it was Debian, Mandrake, Caldera, RH officially became RHEL established a foothold in the enterprise space a Fedora  continued down the community based road.  OpenSuSe wasn't a thing yet, Arch was on the bleeding edge still and much too unstable to serve as a daily driver, Gentoo and their portage, and Slackware was still had a significant presence in the Linux community. I narrowed my choices down to Gentoo, Debian, and Slackware. Decided against Gentoo, I didn't want to spend a lot of time installing an OS. In those days it took 3 hours or so to compile a kernel that was half the size of what compiles in a few minutes now. 

I was on the fence, Debian or Slackware. Both went back to just two years after that historic post from a CompSci student in Finland.
Both were known for stability and security, while Debian's package manager with dependency resolution and tracking was why many flocked to Debian, Slackware took the opposite approach. You alone are responsible for resolving dependency issues, and any other issues that may arise. They had an email address, you ul might get a reply in a few weeks. The IRC was where the gurus were. 

I chose Slackware, not despite those facts, not because of them. The Slackware community is not going to hold your hand. It was common knowledge in the Linux world back that when it came to Slackware, noobs stay away. For advanced users only. The Slackware Way, Pat Volkerdings manifesto outlining the philosophy of the Slackware distribution, aligned perfectly with my beliefs. The clincher, what sealed the deal for me, was something many Slackers have told me also sealed the deal for them, and it was a statement oft repeated by those that compared and contrasted the various distros. ""If you run Redhat, Debian, Mandrake, or one of the other distros, you'll learn that distro. If you run Slackware, you'll learn Linux."" The learning curve  was somewhat steep, but well worth it. I've been running Slackware on every machine I've owned since then, almost 24 years now, but it's because I feel at home in the Slackware community. The community that surrounds a distro are the people you will have to ask to for help, and who will be asking you, so it would serve to have something in common with them. Most of us Slackers are well into middle age, and I'm sure there's more than a few not far from collecting social security. Young people are too impatient to put the time in that or takes to learn Linux on a Slackware machine. To this day I have never recommended Slackware to anyone that asked about a distro.

This resonated with me... 

I had a good time with Gnome2 and the Ubuntu forum for a few years, until Unity kicked me out... then I went over to Cinnamon and joined the Linux Mint forum; again, the experience was pretty good.

After that, I just fancied trying Cinnamon on Manjaro; installed it to some HDD space and was really impressed with the package management... a week later, I wiped it and restored the snapshot to my SSD; then replaced the HDD install with Manjaro PLASMA - which totally bowled me over.

So really I don't give a toss about other folks opinions - I see many comments and criticisms and they just don't resonate. Not into drama, it just works - and I had the same desktop now for nearly 9 years.

Each 'hop' solved issues that I had with the previous distribution - starting with Unity to Cinnamon, then leaving behind the PPA hell in Mint and discovering Pacman, and the AUR... I could just install my Plex Home Theater without any issues, no silly PPA additions, no broken or held back packages.

The biggest bonus - hanging out in the official forum.

The big things in this release:

* [**OBS Global Hotkeys Installer**](https://github.com/hopeseekr/BashScripts/blob/trunk/obs-global-hotkeys) (GNOME Xorg + Wayland):

Quickly installs true OBS Global Hotkeys in GNOME Wayland + Xorg. This script is idempotent and safely finds available keybinding slots without overwriting existing user configurations.

It installs a pure-bash + curl API client for OBS' API and registers it with GNOME's internal global hotkey system. Works with both Xorg and Wayland.

* **turn-off-nvidia: Comprehensive NVIDIA GPU Power Management Script**

**turn-off-nvidia** is a comprehensive bash script for managing NVIDIA dGPU power states on Linux, standing out as one of the few power management solutions that fully supports **NVIDIA GPUs with AMD CPUs on Wayland** while also working perfectly on Xorg. It prioritizes Runtime D3 Power Management (RTD3) as the modern approach, allowing your discrete GPU to automatically enter deep sleep states (D3cold) when idle, dramatically reducing power consumption and heat on laptops.

The script provides multiple configuration methods including supergfxctl (excellent for ASUS laptops and Wayland), envycontrol, optimus-manager, and legacy options like bbswitch and acpi_call. It features intelligent system detection, comprehensive diagnostics, distro-agnostic package management (pacman/AUR, apt, dnf, zypper), PRIME offload setup for on-demand GPU usage, real-time power monitoring, and safe revert options. With extensive documentation and Wayland-specific guidance, turn-off-nvidia makes it simple to achieve optimal battery life on hybrid graphics laptops.

This is pretty much the only solution out there for massive power savings on Nvidia + AMD R9 / AI laptops on Wayland. You can toggle it to completely turn off the Nvidia GPU for the entire session. Reboot to restore.

**This is currently in beta.**

1ntz1qo,Tech,linux,"Linus Torvalds REMOVES the Bcachefs Code from the Linux Kernel With Linux 6.17 was the decision by Linus Torvalds to mark Bcachefs as ""externally maintained"" and not accept any new Bcachefs code into the mainline kernel but keeping the existing code within the tree. That was useful for those relying on Bcachefs to still boot a mainline kernel at least. Now for Linux 6.18, the Bcachefs code was removed from the mainline kernel.

Linus Torvalds a short time ago stripped out the Bcachefs code from the mainline kernel. He commented in the removal:
""bcachefs was marked 'externally maintained' in 6.17 but the code remained to make the transition smoother.

It's now a DKMS module, making the in-kernel code stale, so remove it to avoid any version confusion.""

With that 117k lines are removed from the kernel tree. Bcachefs users should now use the DKMS kernel modules out-of-tree but without any ability to boot the mainline kernel using the stale code found in v6.17.

* **There's macOs.**
   * Not sure why I even mentioned it. It isn't really relevant, as its only available to those who buy overpriced hardware, so that they can then get locked in to only using *more* overpriced hardware with it.
* **We also have Windows.**
   * An antique, legacy, operating system, which would be completely obsolete by now if its manufacturer hadn't managed to get a monopoly over the desktop os market. They recently stuck a nice skin on top of it, for the first time in almost 10 years, but don't let yourself be fooled by its aesthetics. Take a peek under the hood, and the disorganization, inefficiency, bloat, redundancy, and overall chaos, would have you thinking that you're looking at a government instead of a piece of software. (As if to prove my point, as I'm typing this up, I get **a BSOD**.)
* **And then there's** ***Linux.***
   * An engineering feat.
   * Clean.
   * Stable.
   * Organized.
   * Efficient.

# Why is there no software for Linux?

Well, while the tech world depends on Linux, and the only Big Tech company whose servers aren't running Linux is... >!Microsoft,!< >!\- SURPRISE! -!< the percentage of the world at large using Linux is very low. So it just doesn't make $en$e for companies to develop software for Linux. And yes, it takes money to develop good software.

# Why isn't anyone using Linux?

Well some might say, because there's no software, creating a catch-22. But ChromeOS proves that you don't need a good software ecosystem for an OS to become popular. The real reason is ***accessibility***. The average Joe is not installing an OS onto his laptop. He's using whatever it comes with.

In order for Linux to be more widely used, it needs to be that he can go into Walmart or Best Buy, and find Linux devices from established brands like Dell, HP, and Lenovo, as much of an option as Chromebooks, MacBooks, and PCs. Until that happens, Linux will be relegated to servers and geeks.

That's the main point.

Other things that get in the way of widespread Linux adoption is that user-friendly distros like Ubuntu are **90% of the way there** \- but we need to finish off **that last 10%**, polishing it off with **features that consumers expect** like speech-to-text, basic codes, and facial recognition sign-in.

There also needs to be a better **app store**.

If I'm new to Linux and I'm looking for a **professional video editor**, when I open the Ubuntu store I shouldn't be directed to **Shotcut** and **Openshot**, just because **Davinci Resolve** is closed source. And if I'm looking for an **audio editor**, I don't want to hear anything about **Audacity**. We need a **well-designed app store** where a user who's unfamiliar with the options should be able to easily find the best software out there, whether it's open or closed source.

The installation should go 1-2-3, **no failures** because of **unresolved dependencies** or **package conflicts**. It should ***just. work.***

1nsv29p,Tech,linux,"How do Linux distros keep software packages and the kernel up-to-date, what does the process look like? Somehow, I been using Linux and different Linux distros in all sorts of fashion on and off for years but I never really looked much at inner workings of distros and how things go together, in the grand scheme of things. I want to learn more about that!

By chance I read [someone's website ](https://vez.mrsk.me/linux-hardening)about their preferred system settings, and I am not sure how valid and relevant their criticism is; in the first long paragraph they are describing essentially shortcomings in the arduous process of package-maintenance (especially for stable/LTS) and what they think e.g. archlnx does better especially regarding the kernel. Specifically, they are describing that due to many factors, (less-than critical or high) CVE fixes in the kernel might only be merged or pickedup into e.g. debian much later or sometimes not at all for years.

I have no idea what this whole process of ""maintenance"" in distros looks like, neither for general software nor for the kernel. I know pretty much all FOSS nowadays provide some stable/longterm version, as does the kernel, and these versions then contain all the fixes for stable. But what does e.g. debian or ubuntu do then - do they keep all software including the kernel in sync with these original vanilla updates and patches? Does e.g. ""ubuntu lts"" include all ""linux longterm"" patches? Or do all distros have some sort of their own versions of all that software and manually bring in patches from the actual developers whenever ""they feel like it"", whenever they have the time, or whenever it is critically necessary?

And what about backports then?

Is there any Linux distro that ""just"" gives you the latest stable/longterm version of all the software, 1-to-1 without any of their own stuff mixed in? It sounds like arch does that with the kernel? And on Slackware I could just always compile all the latest stable versions, but then I am probably re-installing some packages every single day..?

Canonical has a proven case of near-terminal ‘Not Invented Here’ syndrome and a tendency to avoid things that other distros have standardized on. Snaps are the big poster child for this right now (instead of working to improve the existing Flatpak tooling and resolve the issues they had with it, they decided to create their own thing from scratch and not only made it less efficient and less reliable but also made it harder for developers to actually work with), but LXD, Mir (the original project, not the kiosk-style Wayland compositor it’s now become), Unity, and to a lesser extent Upstart are also pretty high profile examples of this.

That’s really the biggest part of it, but there are a bunch of other reasons as well:

- Ubuntu has shifted more and more over the past few years towards an ‘our way or not at all’ design philosophy that makes it very difficult to do otherwise perfectly sensible things. This is pretty directly at odds with why many people choose to use Linux.

ngnmz6f,Tech,linux,"nan Its... a bit complicated.  And kind of goes back to what an Antivirus is, how they work and what the current threats are, and how they wirk.

MS, in Desktop environments alone, has 70% marketshare.  The majority of Windows users are novice and minimally tech functional.  Which means its like the herbivores on the serengeti plain.  Lots of easy targets.  85% of exploits, are based around ""people"" problems...  password insufficiency, phishing vectors, dumpster diving, not physically securing USB ports on a public embedded kiosk.  The exploit allows tailored malware for a windows environment to be inserted, sometimes simply by plugging a flash drive in.

That malware, is typically targeted at common applications on those windows machines to escalate until the exploit can get paid...

Script kiddies, typically, don't write their own malware, they use precompiled or automated dispensers...  so the malware has some fairly specific signatures.  At one time, it was a strategy to collect these signatures and supply them to developers to create software to scan for those signatures...  the Age of the AV scanner was born.  There are even some algorithms in play to detect signatures that look a lot like known malware, or doing the same things as known malware, and now we had adaptive heuristic scanners...  the problem, when a real black hat sits down, or group sits down, some State Sponsored...  the AV scanner doesn't see it...  and the users are under a false sense of security, because they have an AV scanner, updated or not.

The average infiltration is not detected for 300+ days...

Then there's Linux.  Linux only has 5% of the desktop market share.  Better than half are technically savvy, and  Linux by default, begins implementing least privilege file security.  There ARE linux exploits...  the trick is finding a Linux users they can be deployed against...  and not be discovered.  Then tracked, then counter-attacked...

Predators, typically dont predate upon other predators...  hyenas dont attack lions directly, except in packs after lions have forged on a carcass. Hyenas are script kiddy groups and pick the bones from a lions<serious black hats> kill...  a lot of analogies can be made about the hacking environment.

If you a running a network with windows users and/or file sharing/hosting, its a good idea to setup an AV scanner like Clam to routinely scan and update...  this keeps your pool from becoming poisoned with malware, and signals to would be attackers you are proactively secure, assuming they get past your firewalls, IDS/IPS, honeypot and defense in depth strategy.  If for no other reason to appear secure...  no security system is impenetrable, so, you make it more trouble to get in so there are easier targets.  Be a zebra instead of an antelope.

Using secure updates, checking the hash signatures during updates, multiple repositories in trusted institutions...also reduces the likelihood of an exploited package.

What We Know About the NPM Supply Chain Attack | Trend Micro (US) https://share.google/Hb4opDKP9TxeWcO0Z

This is what a successful exploit on a non-windows system looks like.  It was discovered fairly quickly, acquired about 500 dollars of crypto... its costing considerably more to clean up...  But...  it did not have a profitable payload for tge number of impacted systems, in the millions-and all they got was 500 bucks...  when they attribute the attack, and they will, club Fed, for a good little bit, over 500 bucks...  if that had been a windows attack, it would have  taken longer to detect, longer to intercept and secured a greater payday.  It started from phish email on a maintainer...<people problem>.

So, immune?  No such thing.  When Linux hits about 15% marketshare...  there will be significantly more exploits because the user base will have expanded to include a greater proportion of n00b users, and users are the weakest link.  The current CISA recommendation is 16 characters and the full ascii table for passwords...  that means users are going to use password managers and writing them down... people are the weakest link.  Due to the distributed method of linux packages across repositories and those counterchecking each others hashes...<that's how the npm repo was detected so fast-and isolated to one maintainers credentials-not how MS and Apple do things.>  its more difficult for malware to be slipped in to files with system credentials.  User files<non-admin> are of less ""value"" in an exploit, unless they can get escalated privileges...

1ns8qzz,Tech,linux,"Linux desktop is attracting new users, and that's good, but we must be critical of everything that needs improvement I recently returned to Linux after a 2-3 year absence, and I was surprised by how well it has evolved on the desktop. More stability, compatibility with more software, mature DEs... it's a real pleasure.

However, I also notice that the Linux community has some areas for improvement from different points of view (its organization, how it welcomes newbies, software, etc.). I'm writing this post just to see if others see the same things I do. If not, that's fine, you can give your opposing opinion and debate it, no need to lynch me. Here we go:

1. Dependence on large companies. Yes, I know, they are precisely the ones that finance and support Linux the most, but at the same time, they do nothing but twist the community to their liking, sometimes damaging it. We have Canonical imposing its Snaps on Ubuntu, even hijacking you when you try to install using ""sudo apt install"", probably the most well-known distro among the general public. In addition, more recently, there has been some debate about replacing GNU tools with a rewrite in RUST that will be licensed under MIT (more permissive, allowing those who benefit from the code and modify it to not have to share the result, privatizing it).

We also have Red Hat, which two years ago decided to restrict access to the RHEL source code to the community, citing that others were benefiting “unfairly” from that access, as other companies (ie, CIQ) were creating clones of RHEL and then offering support and charging for it.

All these developments don't seem positive for the Linux community and are reminiscent of how Microsoft treats Windows, which is manipulated like their toy. Of course, there are still other “community” distributions, such as Debian or Arch, although they are not as easy for beginners to get started with.

2) Division of efforts. It is in the nature of Linux that everyone can create their own “home,” and therefore, it is inevitable that there will be hundreds of distributions, but when there is none that is capable of being “perfect” for the general public (there is always some drawback, however small, in Gnome, KDE, Cinnamon...), it seems incredible that efforts continue to be divided even further. We have the PopOS! team as example, although they started well and gained some popularity in their day, now they seem to think it is worthy their time and effort to create another new DE (COSMIC), just... because? Until in the end, we have almost as many DEs as distributions, and some with very little usage (how many people use Budgie? What future will MATE have?).

I understand that customization is the soul of Linux, but sometimes it feels like it weighs it down a lot. “Divide and conquer,” they said about the vanquished.

3) Lack of consistency. Similar to the above, in Linux you can do anything, that's clear, but it won't help its “mass” adoption if the instructions for doing basic things change so much depending on the distribution or DE. Sometimes, even what is compatible can be affected by things that the casual user doesn't understand (X11 vs Wayland, for example).

4) Comfort with using “advanced” applications or settings. For example, no one is incentivized to build open-source software that synchronizes clouds (Google Drive, OneDrive, and others, similar to InsyncHQ, with active real-time synchronization), because advanced users have more than enough with RClone and the terminal. Or in specific configurations, the terminal is still unavoidable. If you want to install drivers for an HP Laserjet printer, you'll have to go through the terminal. Want to install Warp VPN? Terminal! It's not bad at all, don't get me wrong, but it makes me angry that there is still a certain complacency that prevents Linux from being “chewed up” a little more to attract the general public, which would help popularize Linux and make more native software compatible.

5) Lack of attention to cybersecurity. Beginners are often told not to worry, that “there is no malware” on Linux desktops. At the same time, we have seen how Arch's AUR repository has been detected with malware, or how certain vulnerabilities have affected Linux this year (Sudo having a PAM vulnerability allowing full root access, two CUPS bugs that let attackers remote DoS and bypass auth, DoS flaw in the kernel's KSMBD subsystem, Linux kernel vulnerability exploited from Chrome renderer sandbox... And all of that, only in the last 2 months).

Related to this are questionable configurations, such as trusting Flatpak 100%, even though the software available there can often be packages created by anonymous third parties and not the original developer, or the use of browsers installed in this way, even though this means that the browser's own sandbox is replaced by Flatpak's sandboxing.

6) Updates that have the capacity to break entire systems, to the point of recommending reinstalling the system from scratch in some cases. This is almost on par with Windows or worse, depending on the distribution and changes that have taken place. It is well known that in Linux, depending on the distro, updating is a lottery and can leave you without a system. This should be unacceptable, although understandable, given that Linux is still a base (monolithic kernel with +30M lines) with a bunch of modules linked together on top, each one different from the other. In the end, it is very easy for things to break when updating.

In part, immutable distributions help with this, allowing you to revert to a previous state when, inevitably, the day comes when the system breaks, unless you can afford to have a system with hardly any modifications, with software as close to a “clean” state as possible.

If the system breaks and you are not on an immutable distribution, you have already lost the casual user.

At the end, I want to love Linux, but I see that many of the root causes preventing its popularity from growing (on the desktop, I'm not counting its use as a kernel for heavily modified things like Android, or its use by professional people in servers) haven't consideribly improved. The community remains deeply divided, fighting amongst itself even on some issues, and continues to scare away the general public who come with the idea of “just having work done”.

Because of all this, a few days ago, I was surprised to see that Linux in the Steam survey remains at 2.64%. It's better than the 1.87% from just a year ago (Sept. 24), of course, and I suppose SteamDecks have helped a lot too, but it's a shame that it's not able to attract the audience that is migrating elsewhere on Windows (Windows 11 went from 47.69% to 60.39% in the same period, even with all the TPM thing that will make millions of PCs ""incompatible"" with Win11). In other words, for every person who switched to Linux in the survey, more than 16 people switched to Windows 11.

ngkmyjc,Tech,linux,"nan 1. It is completely impossible to have linux without corporate contribution, none of your hardware will work. If the community don't like corporations way of doing things, there is always resistance, like what happened to OpenOffice getting forked into LibreOffice or how nobody adopted snaps opting for flatpak instead

2. A lot of the DE split has been due to Gnome, many are forks of Gnome 2 when people didn't like the way Gnome 3 was going. Of course in such cases it isn't uncommon for there to be multiple different splits due to different ideas as some want to optimize and make light desktops(MATE), while others want for features(Cinnamon).

And Cosmic wasn't created for no reason. Originally, Pop modified the original Gnome. But the issue was that Gnome didn't care for the stuff Pop wanted as contributions. The amount of work it took to keep modifying Gnome for Pop, it was easier to just make their own DE.

3. x11 vs wayland thing is a temporary thing that will sort itself out, we are at a transition point but give it about 2 years or so and it'll be far more clear

4. These are software vendor choices, they can easily put a GUI on top of all those terminal commands. You can't force vendors to add a gui, it is just their choice. Also, most printers should work with CUPS. 

As for clouds, DEs have cloud integrations in them. I know KDE has them via kio extensions

My main gripes are : Windows hides a lot of what is going on under the hood from you. It is hard to tell what is running, how it is configured (the registry sucks when you want to see what parameters are set, to what value and what the values do), and logging is horrible. When you have a crash of some process or the system as a whole it is very hard, if possible at all, to find out what went wrong. Most of the time all you can do is restart the process or system and hope it doesn't happen again.

I always had this notion that me as the user should be able to be in control of a computer more.

Even my own employer, Red Hat, no longer contributes to libxml2.
Good news is several Google and Apple engineers have volunteered to help with libxml2 and libxslt security issues, despite your effort to sabotage libxml2 users -- especially web browser users -- by disclosing all vulnerabilities immediately rather than allowing them the industry-standard 90 day disclosure deadline used by all other GNOME projects (#913 (closed)).

To really understand why people were excited about it in the beginning, it may help to look at [some of the online discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/comp.os.minix/c/dlNtH7RRrGA/m/SwRavCzVE7gJ) after Linus announced it.

There were really three things that made it stand out.

1. It worked (at least on Linus's computer).

2. It was before BSD had been released, making it the first Unix kernel that was ""free as in freedom"" and ""free as in beer"" that could be used on personal computers. There was a version of Unix for PCs called Minix, but it was very expensive.

3. Not only was it ""open-source"", it was GPLed. The [GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) is a specific Free Open Source Software license, which guarantees that your contributions can't be locked into some proprietary, non-open-source project. In other words, if you contribute to the community, it stays in the community. And if anyone wants to base a product on changes they make to your work, that product must also be open source.

That's it. That's what made it special in the beginning.

Understandably, you might ask how is that special. It's special because it encouraged people to contribute and make it better. And eventually, you ended up with such a huge community of contributors that it became the greatest software project in history, running virtually ever server on the internet.

Compare this to 386BSD which was released about a year later and was then forked to create FreeBSD and other Unix OSes. BSD is also open source. But it's a much more permissive license. If you contribute code to it, anyone can take that code and use it in a proprietary software product without even letting you look at how they used it. If you copy ""their"" code, they can sue you, even though you wrote some of it.

One might expect that paradigm to be less encouraging to contributors, especially as time passes and those contributors morph into large software companies who are competing with each other. Why would they want to spend money helping to develop something, if their competitor can then take that work and not make their own changes available to anyone?

What made it special in the beginning was not some amazing quality factor or killer feature. It was a hobbyist project by a college student in Finland. He didn't think it would be a big deal, but he put a lot of effort into making it work for himself, and he knew that it would be interesting to other hobbyists and that if others also contributed, it would get even better.

Uh, the speaker seems to be trying to talk about the split lock mitigation on x86 in linux, but is severely confused.

The split lock mitigation is an _intentional_ speed bump added to the kernel, for the benefit of developers that inadvertently relied on support for misaligned access in x86 for certain atomic operations that can technically function when accessing data across cache lines, but are horridly slow when they do. This is a programming error, and should be easily corrected in the application code. IIUC gcc doesn't even support emitting atomic instructions with misaligned access. The option makes this slow operation _even slower_ and enables [alignment check](https://wiki.osdev.org/Exceptions#Alignment_Check) exceptions to log about it and ensure that the programmer notices the error, as otherwise without a careful microbenchmark it might be difficult to identify the cause.

LWN article that discusses the impact on game performance: https://lwn.net/Articles/911219/.

1nr6lot,Tech,linux,"[KDE/X11] Blazing Fast Application Startup (at the cost of 1.5 GB RAM) Hello Linux community! I've had a great experience with a startup script for KDE that I've written that keeps your specified programs hidden in another Activity to boost startup time of opening commonly used windows like Firefox, Visual Studio Code, Obsidian, and Firefox PWAs. The only downside is that it uses 1.5 GB of memory which isn't much of a sacrifice if you have 16 GB or 32 GB.

A video can be found on my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/1nr659z/x11_blazing_fast_application_startup_at_the_cost/).

**THIS REQUIRES X11** because it uses xdotool and KDE Window Rules that target Window Classes which doesn't work on Wayland. Install `qdbus6` and `xdotool` if it isn't installed already.

## Window Rules

If using Firefox PWAs, make a new PWA for `https://blank.page/`, then find its PWA ID from its `.desktop` file in `~/.local/share/applications/`. It will be used in a regular expression for the Window Rule.

Make a Window Rule with the following settings:

- Description: autohide warmup programs
- Window class: Regular expression; `^(FFPWA-01K4Z047J6WNGHK9RWE19Q0JGQ|firefox|Code|obsidian|)$`
- Window types: Normal window
- Add properties
  - Minimized: Force; Yes
  - Skip taskbar: Force; Yes
  - Skip pager: Force; Yes
  - Skip switcher: Force; Yes

Test it by having one of the windows open and enabling the rule, but be careful if you're using Firefox right now because it will be minimized and you can't unminimize it for your current session without wmctrl. The window should be forced hidden and cannot be Alt-Tabbed to.

## Find the Window Rule ID

Open `~/.config/kwinrulesrc`, and locate the rule we just created by searching for its Description, and put the following underneath the Description line:

```
 Enabled=false
```

Above the Description line is a unique ID that you need to copy. Mine is `[4e198a98-2811-4a63-9aa6-51b186a26bd1]`.

## .xinitrc

Edit or make `~/.xinitrc` if it doesn't already exist. Insert the following, changing the Window Rule ID to yours that you copied in the previous step:

```
#!/bin/sh

# start startup programs without compositing and skip panel
sed -i ""/\[4e198a98-2811-4a63-9aa6-51b186a26bd1\]/,/^\[/ {
  s/Enabled=false/Enabled=true/
}"" ~/.config/kwinrulesrc

exec startplasma-x11
```

## Creating Dummy Activity

Create a new Activity in the KDE Settings app, and name it something like Other. Run the following in your terminal to fetch it's ID:

```
kactivities-cli --list-activities
```
Copy it for later.

## Startup script

Create an empty file, ideally where you keep scripts or somewhere in PATH, and name it `warmup-programs`, then put the following in it. Inside the script, make sure to

- Change the Firefox PWA ID for the empty page PWA to yours from its .desktop shortcut from earlier
- Find your Firefox's profile folder that has a `sessionstore-backups` folder. It is usually inside something similar to `~/.mozilla/firefox/xtv5ktwu.default-release/sessionstore-backups -r`, but you need to change the random series of letters to match your folder.
- The above step deletes your previous session's backups every time you login if Firefox got abruptly closed. This way the previously opened tabs don't get opened in the empty Firefox window that gets hidden in another Activity and hog more memory.
- Copy the Other Activity ID into its place at the bottom (there is an all-caps comment indicating where to put it)
- Follow the other all-caps comments

```
#!/bin/bash

# CHANGE TO MATCH YOUR FIREFOX PROFILE FOLDER
# remove session backups so they don't open in the new firefox window that gets opened and hidden
rm ~/.mozilla/firefox/xtv5ktwu.default-release/sessionstore-backups -r

    if ! xdotool search --class ""$title"" >/dev/null; then
      all_found=false
      break
    fi
    all_found=true
  done
  if ""$all_found""; then
    break
  fi
  sleep 2
done

sleep 2

# CHANGE TO MATCH YOUR WINDOW RULE ID
# reenable compositing and panel rendering for programs
sed -i ""/\[4e198a98-2811-4a63-9aa6-51b186a26bd1\]/,/^\[/ {
  s/Enabled=true/Enabled=false/
}"" ~/.config/kwinrulesrc

qdbus6 org.kde.KWin /KWin reconfigure

sleep 5

declare -a apps=(""Firefox"" ""blank"" ""Obsidian"" ""Code"")

# loop through each window and move them to the activity Other
for app in ""${apps[@]}""; do
  xdotool search --class ""$app"" | while read -r wid; do
    if [[ -n ""$wid"" ]]; then
      # PUT YOUR Other ACTIVITY ID INTO THIS LINE WHERE MINE IS
      xprop -f _KDE_NET_WM_ACTIVITIES 8s -id ""$wid"" -set _KDE_NET_WM_ACTIVITIES ""1487a88b-b741-40b7-ba37-4afcdf525253""
    fi
  done
done
```

Give it executable privileges with `chmod u+x warmup-programs`.

## autostart file

Make a file named `warmup-programs.desktop` in `~/.config/autostart` with the following contents, changing the path to the script to the appropriate location:

```
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Exec=bash -c '~/Bin/warmup-programs'
Hidden=false
NoDisplay=false
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
Name=Warmup programs
Comment=Warmup programs and hide them from main activity
```

## Logout/Reboot to test it

You have to wait about 5-7 seconds after logging in for the programs to load in the background then get moved to the Other Activity. You should know it's done when your panel flickers or something. I use a custom theme so it gets reloaded when `qdbus6 org.kde.KWin /KWin reconfigure` gets ran. Now you can open up your programs!

## Firefox New Window fix

For Firefox shortcuts to websites you place on your desktop (not PWAs), you have to edit them to be like this so when clicked, the won't bring up the Firefox instance in the Other Activity:

```
[Desktop Entry]
Icon=/home/prestonharberts/Pictures/icons/favicons/teams.ico
Name=https://teams.microsoft.com/v2/
Type=Application
Exec=firefox --new-window https://teams.microsoft.com/v2/
Terminal=false
```

## Conclusion - TL;DR

Now you can open up windows very quickly at the cost of some memory! You only have to wait 5-7 seconds for the script to finish running upon signing in to your computer. This is a lengthy guide, but I hope it helps someone out there.

I've optimized this script to use as little memory as possible by opening `about:blank` in Firefox, an empty folder in Visual Studio Code, an empty vault in Obsidian, and `https://blank.page/` for Firefox PWA.

Distro-hopping has been fun, but I finally feel like I’ve found my setup.

For me, native packages > sandboxed ones. That ruled out Ubuntu (since they push snap) and led me toward Fedora/RHEL-based distros. Fedora was great for a while, but the short release cycle sometimes caused package/version headaches. That’s when I looked into RHEL and its family, CentOS, Rocky, Alma. I ended up on AlmaLinux because it’s stable, backed by big players, and feels future-proof.

On the desktop side, I love i3WM, but I need good GUI and hardware support. GNOME hits that balance, and with custom keybindings I’ve got it behaving a lot like i3. Honestly, I was worried AlmaLinux would feel old or limited, but it surprised me, it feels just like Fedora 40, and everything works smoothly.

Linux has been with me since school, and now as a young working adult, I’m thankful for the community. Every distro, every DE, much respect to all the devs and contributors.

1nqs4w3,Tech,linux,"Rescued my crashed NVME drive to a new one. AMA Recently my desktop main 2TB nvme drive with arch linux installed on it suddenly went into read-only mode just after booting, throwing up all kinds of errors. I quickly ordered a new nvme drive (same size) and have not touched the crashed drive since.

The errors:

    Sep 24 16:51:39 danktank kernel: nvme1n1: Write(0x1) @ LBA 2780645808, 8 blocks, Attempted Write to Read Only Range (sct 0x1 / sc 0x82) DNR

    Sep 24 16:51:39 danktank kernel: Buffer I/O error on device nvme1n1p2, logical block 347449398

Once i got my new drive i used [ddrescue](https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual.html) to copy the crashed drive to the new NVME via a bootable usb stick linux environment:

    # Clone entire source (/dev/nvme0n1) to destination (/dev/nvme1n1)
    sudo ddrescue -f -n /dev/nvme0n1 /dev/nvme1n1 rescue.log
    # Second pass to retry bad areas
    sudo ddrescue -d -r3 /dev/nvme0n1 /dev/nvme1n1 rescue.log

Ran fsck on the new device to fix any filesystem errors that occured on the old drive:

    e2fsck -f /dev/nvme1n1p1
    e2fsck -f /dev/nvme1n1p2

Removed the old nvme from my system (since we now have conflicting disk UUID's), booted up, held my heart... and it actually booted!

Some more issues arose, since some of the files were corrupted. Hyprland would not boot, a lot of weird library errors when starting some software.

Solution

    # Re-install all the packages from pacman that 
    # are currently installed. Force overwrite any 
    # files that are still lingering around.
    
    # Use this with caution, i'm not responsible for 
    # anything that breaks if you run this on your 
    # perfectly fine system.
    
    # This was only used because my system was just cloned 
    # from a broken disk, and i had little to lose anyway.
    
    pacman -Qnq | pacman -S --noconfirm --overwrite '*' -

Now i'm back to running my old desktop environment without the need to install a whole new linux environment. Pretty happy with the outcome.

If anyone has any comment of what i could have done better, or what i can do on the newly recovered environment to make sure i will not run into issues in the future please let me know!

• \*\*Qubes OS\*\* - Security through isolation, compartmentalization of activities

\*\*Mainstream Privacy-Hardened Options:\*\*



• \*\*Fedora\*\* with privacy tweaks - Solid security model, good hardware support

• \*\*Debian\*\* - Stable, transparent, community-driven, excellent for hardening

• \*\*openSUSE Tumbleweed\*\* - Rolling release with security focus

• \*\*Pop!\_OS\*\* - Ubuntu-based but removes telemetry, privacy-respecting



\*\*Key Privacy Principles:\*\*

1. Stick to well-maintained, audited distributions

2. Avoid obscure distros without active communities

3. Privacy is more about configuration than distro choice

4. Consider your threat model - what are you protecting against?

\- VPN service (Mullvad, ProtonVPN)

\- Browser hardening (Firefox + uBlock Origin)

ng4ffx1,Tech,linux,"nan Read the above comment twice, then my recommendation below.

First, and you are probably aware, privacy and security is not the same thing. I’d encourage you to give serious thought to which is your priority.

My personal opinion is that privacy is overrated as a priority. Straight up, I think for most people, it’s a mental thing. Personally I don’t care if a few companies build a profile of me. It’s definitely creepy, but I’m not doing anything I need to worry about.

Of course, if we get to the point that a state-level actor is coming after people for their identity or politics, I’m screwed anyway. I decided a while ago that it was too much stress to live in a way that hides who I am or what I believe.

Security, on the other hand, is serious business. Instead of trying to leave no digital fingerprints, I focus on protecting what I can’t afford to lose. I end up doing using some of the same tools… uMatrix, uBlock, etc, but you will never catch me paying money for a VPN.

So if you become interested in running a secure system, look into secure-blue, built on Fedora Atomic. It’s a distro with security as the top priority using a well-developed tech stack as the base.

I haven’t used it myself, because like u/Icy_Calligrapher4022 said, most any distro will have you covered. Regular Fedora has been sufficient for my concerns. I’ll never use Ubuntu because I feel like Canonical has given us reason not to trust them, but Debian and if you have edge case hardware, Linux Mint and LMDE are right there.",['linux'],read the above comment twice then my recommendation below first and you are probably aware privacy and security is not the same thing id encourage you to give serious thought to which is your priority my personal opinion is that privacy is overrated as a priority straight up i think for most people its a mental thing personally i dont care if a few companies build a profile of me its definitely creepy but im not doing anything i need to worry about of course if we get to the point that a statelevel actor is coming after people for their identity or politics im screwed anyway i decided a while ago that it was too much stress to live in a way that hides who i am or what i believe security on the other hand is serious business instead of trying to leave no digital fingerprints i focus on protecting what i cant afford to lose i end up doing using some of the same tools umatrix ublock etc but you will never catch me paying money for a vpn so if you become interested in running a secure system look into secureblue built on fedora atomic its a distro with security as the top priority using a welldeveloped tech stack as the base i havent used it myself because like uicycalligrapher said most any distro will have you covered regular fedora has been sufficient for my concerns ill never use ubuntu because i feel like canonical has given us reason not to trust them but debian and if you have edge case hardware linux mint and lmde are right there,positive

Whether it in military contracts, or being able to support expensive SANs with certified drivers, or getting official certifications to run commercial SQL databases... this is what Redhat exists for. 

They make a living by providing paying users what they want and what they need. 

The entire point of operating systems is to make it easier and more convenient to write, run, and manage software.  That is it. That is why OSes exist. That is the only thing they are good for. 

So If Redhat intentionally made it hard for users to run the software they want (CUDA) then the solution users are going to come up with isn't to stop using CUDA. It is to stop using Linux. 


The customers are the ones in charge here. Not Redhat. 

If users want CUDA then CUDA is going to exist.

nhtavh9,Tech,sysadmin,"nan You can’t convert a local/domain profile to Entra ID in-place; pick hybrid join first or do an Azure AD join and migrate the profile.

Fastest, low-drama path: set up Entra Connect with Password Hash Sync, fix UPNs to your M365 domain, enable Hybrid Azure AD Join, and roll out OneDrive Known Folder Move so user data rides to the cloud. Users keep logging into the domain profile while devices register to Entra; verify with dsregcmd /status. When you’re ready to ditch AD, disjoin from the domain, Join this device to Azure Active Directory, then either restore from OneDrive or use ForensiT User Profile Wizard (or USMT) to attach the old profile to the new AzureAD account.

1nxz3zv,Tech,sysadmin,"Directive to move away from Microsoft Hey everyone,

I’m currently planning to move away from Microsoft’s ecosystem and I’m looking for advice on the best way to replace Microsoft Entra (Azure AD).

Here’s my setup:

On-prem Active Directory (hybrid setup)

Entra ID is currently used for user provisioning, SSO, and app integrations (around 300+ apps).

Microsoft 365 (email, Teams, SharePoint, etc.) is being replaced with Lark/Feishu — that transition has already started.


Now I’m trying to figure out what’s the best way to replace Entra ID and other related Microsoft services — ideally something that can:

Integrate with my existing on-prem AD

Handle SSO and provisioning for SaaS apps

Provide conditional access or similar access control features

Offer an overall smooth migration path


Reason for the change:
The company is moving away from US-based products and prefers using China-owned or non-US solutions where possible.

Would really appreciate recommendations from anyone who’s done something similar — what solutions are you using for identity, security, and endpoint management after moving away from Microsoft?

I control a couple Linux servers we have, but that’s about it. Networking, user accounts, it all has to go through IT. The most access I have is LDAP read access to the production AD environment. 

I worked service desk, and the whole concept of having a conversation about adding users to a group outside of a ticketing system is really off putting. I can understand troubleshooting over a phone call (I hated trying to troubleshoot a users problem over email), but initiating the request via a Slack message is a whole different thing in my mind. My manager keeps telling me “oh, contact John Smith directly for this, they will help you. A ticket will take too long”. 

Most of the time, they are very nice and seem willing to help. But I just feel bad ripping them away from the ticket desk because “I’m special”. On the flip side, the company I work for is massive. The ticket desk is used by many departments. I’m fairly certain they have a few people on payroll just for triaging tickets to the correct department. My manager is correct, it can often take about a week just for your ticket to land with the right person, then another few days for it to be actioned, when all I needed was a single IP address allocated. It can genuinely block a project, when it’s something so small and simple yet very critical. 

I’ve asked one of the people I talk to regularly, and she says she actually prefer I message directly for small things. Another person I asked said it’s okay because I’m “always very competent and respectful”.

1ny74zz,Tech,linux,"Rant about finding/using notetaking apps with handwriting support So I am a recent adopter of Linux in the form of Ubuntu on my Framework 12 I recently received. I have had some *minor* exposure to Linux in the past in the form of WSL, but this is my first time running on a dedicated machine.

Because the Framework 12 has a touchscreen/tablet mode, I wanted to take advantage of that and use a stylus to take notes, so I picked up a Metapen and took a look around.

Xournal++ came up immediately on searching around and seemed top recommended, and for the drawing specifically, it works the best of anything I've tried. There's 2 features it has for drawing that I love. 

1. The ""eraser"" end of the stylus works automatically without issues. This one I have seen **some** other apps that this works for. 

2. The eraser actually erases where you use it, instead of just deleting a whole penstroke when it touches just a pixel of it. I haven't seen **any** other apps where the eraser functions like that.

However, Xournal++ also has 2 drawbacks.

1. There is no option for infinite canvas or even pages of different sizes, just 8.5x11"". This would be something I would love to have, but is less of a downside than the second that drives me NUTS:
2. For as good as the drawing implementation is, the text formatting options are ridiculously bad/nonexistent. As a student I commonly copy-paste things into notes, but there is zero automatic text-wrapping. Any text that is either typed or copy-pasted will go off the edge of the page, and you have to manually put in line breaks to be able to have it all fit on your \*statically sized\* page.

Can anyone either recommend a different app that satisfies my requirements or point out the existence of some Xournal branch I don't know of? Or will I just have to learn C++ and do it myself?

There are reasons for FOSS and there are reasons for proprietary software. I recommend to read at least the first few parts of the Cathedral and the Bazaar (e.g. https://archive.org/details/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar_ )

On my personal computer, most prop. apps are games. Obsidian is prop, albeit free as in beer to use. When on Windows, drivers and software for all kinds of hardware is proprietary - like the software to update my TomTom navigation system.

Inkscape vs. Designer is an even closer call - there are functions only one of them has in both. (the hardest to get around is the lack of CMYK support in Inkscape, but you can make do)

nhqco31,Tech,linux,"nan I have to criticize this.

tld;dr: **Yes, use equalizer.** There is no difference between additive and subtractive equalizer in this context -- all you have to do is compute the preamp gain to avoid clipping the signal if you are worried about boosting a frequency resulting to clipping. I have a confession to make: I apply about +5 dB bass to my headphones without using -5 dB preamp. This is because the analog level is set quite high in my setup and volume control is achieved digitally, and there is basically always tons of headroom.

To me, it is very strange to claim that you can't use equalizer to create a flat tonal balance in your system output, because the thing doesn't play loud enough. You got to cut bass appropriately to your speakers, like everything below 100 Hz, say, but I am fully expecting that the rest is played quite well. You can use e.g. Linux Studio Plugins equalizer to create appropriate high pass filter to avoid overtaxing the speaker unit. For physics reasons, it is low frequency output that requires either large amplitude or large surface area. Transducers create pressure by causing acceleration in the membrane, and so the interval that the sound wave switches between positive and negative acceleration changes the amplitude of the motion. Each time you halve the frequency, you actually quadruple the amplitude that is needed to maintain same physical sound pressure level. 

""Sub – More or less vibrations up to something an ear can barely hear. Everything from 10 Hz to \~40 Hz."" Sure, I can buy that 10 Hz is just vibrations, but 40 Hz is a clearly audible bass tone and achievable routinely by almost all headphones and likely also by speakers that have around 6"" woofer surface area or more. Maybe 40 Hz doesn't come out of any laptop, but that's simply not a justification for describing 40 Hz as barely perceivable to a human. What the hell?

Limiter - Filter - etc. plugin recommendations. Just no. Don't mess with dynamic range if you can avoid it, rather. There can be a good application for dynamic range compression, like when listening in noisy environment, but I struggle here with the mental image of a laptop blaring distorted sound at near-constant volume that is about max of what the transducers are capable of. That will probably sound awful the whole time, no matter what, and I'd rather have correct sound at a lower level than this.

My recommendation would be to delete that article from your memory, and purchase a calibrated measurement microphone like UMIK-1, then measure the laptop's frequency response in the listening position with all effects disabled. For best result, the measurement should be performed outside with good distance from the ground, or in an anechoic room where reflections are also minimized. Only a single person has to own such a microphone and do a good job measuring the system, in order to generate the data for creating accurate equalizer profile. Software such as auto\_eq can compute the parametric filters, or you can do it in REW. A website that collects and publishes the original measurements and resulting derived equalization might be good -- it doesn't have to be anything more complex than REW mdat files and the resulting Equalizer APO compatible settings files that most software (including Linux Studio Plugins' equalizer) can read...",['linux'],i have to criticize this tlddr yes use equalizer there is no difference between additive and subtractive equalizer in this context all you have to do is compute the preamp gain to avoid clipping the signal if you are worried about boosting a frequency resulting to clipping i have a confession to make i apply about db bass to my headphones without using db preamp this is because the analog level is set quite high in my setup and volume control is achieved digitally and there is basically always tons of headroom to me it is very strange to claim that you cant use equalizer to create a flat tonal balance in your system output because the thing doesnt play loud enough you got to cut bass appropriately to your speakers like everything below hz say but i am fully expecting that the rest is played quite well you can use eg linux studio plugins equalizer to create appropriate high pass filter to avoid overtaxing the speaker unit for physics reasons it is low frequency output that requires either large amplitude or large surface area transducers create pressure by causing acceleration in the membrane and so the interval that the sound wave switches between positive and negative acceleration changes the amplitude of the motion each time you halve the frequency you actually quadruple the amplitude that is needed to maintain same physical sound pressure level sub more or less vibrations up to something an ear can barely hear everything from hz to hz sure i can buy that hz is just vibrations but hz is a clearly audible bass tone and achievable routinely by almost all headphones and likely also by speakers that have around woofer surface area or more maybe hz doesnt come out of any laptop but thats simply not a justification for describing hz as barely perceivable to a human what the hell limiter filter etc plugin recommendations just no dont mess with dynamic range if you can avoid it rather there can be a good application for dynamic range compression like when listening in noisy environment but i struggle here with the mental image of a laptop blaring distorted sound at nearconstant volume that is about max of what the transducers are capable of that will probably sound awful the whole time no matter what and id rather have correct sound at a lower level than this my recommendation would be to delete that article from your memory and purchase a calibrated measurement microphone like umik then measure the laptops frequency response in the listening position with all effects disabled for best result the measurement should be performed outside with good distance from the ground or in an anechoic room where reflections are also minimized only a single person has to own such a microphone and do a good job measuring the system in order to generate the data for creating accurate equalizer profile software such as autoeq can compute the parametric filters or you can do it in rew a website that collects and publishes the original measurements and resulting derived equalization might be good it doesnt have to be anything more complex than rew mdat files and the resulting equalizer apo compatible settings files that most software including linux studio plugins equalizer can read,positive

Friend, respectfully, this isn't the ""early stages"" of anything; this is ""had a stray, generic thought about AI."" You don't have a problem statement or use-case scenario. Your target audience is too large and undifferentiated to qualify as a functional target. But the most damning thing is that it doesn't appear you've done any domain research or market evaluation whatsoever. The vague features you've described already exist in ubiquitous industry tools like Westlaw and Lexis. Those features are... okay. I wouldn't pay for them on their own, but they're a nice throw-in and occasionally helpful. To the extent there's any industry appetite for LLM babble in law, mediocre sheisters like Harvey, Legora, and Vincent largely swallow up that market. Finally, AI is the new ""third rail"" issue in many jurisdictions, and many firms are taking a cautious wait-and-see approach while courts and state bar associations formulate responsible usage guidelines. You're just gonna have to wait for that dust to settle before you can effectively evaluate a potential market.

I used to work for one of the major economic consulting companies in the US supporting experts in disputes (think economists testifying in breach of contract, antitrust, finance, securities types of cases). Is there anyone working on anything cool in the expert witness space?

From some of my own research, there doesn't seem to be much happening there in terms of tech. Is there anyone here who has worked in the industry or have used any ""tech"" products in this space?

I'm seeing a couple of business categories here:

* **Expert Witness Directories:** some of these literally still look like a website from the 2000s or an old school phonebook. Experts pay for listings that cost in the hundreds of dollars range.
* **Expert Search Networks:** Attorneys pay for experts search services where a firm source experts for a price. From what I can tell, payments can be engagement based or the search firm takes a cut of the expert hourly fee. The most tech enabled firm I can find in this space seems to be [https://www.expertinstitute.com/](https://www.expertinstitute.com/).
* **Expert Research:** Attorneys pay for research reports that cover an expert's litigation history, past testimonies, publications, etc. Products in this space include [https://www.expertinstitute.com/expert-iq/expert-radar/](https://www.expertinstitute.com/expert-iq/expert-radar/) and [https://expertwitnessprofiler.com/](https://expertwitnessprofiler.com/).

**Source:** Sean Harrington, Director of Technology Innovation, [University of Oklahoma College of Law](https://law.ou.edu/) (in a private message to me)

The Clio / vLex merger and announcements at Cliocon were HUGE.  We've never seen anything like that in law and a huge investment/bet that Clio made has paid off.  They've done so much in the 4 short months that they've been working with the vLex devs.  I can't imagine what they're going to do next year.  It was a massive acceleration in legal tech AI and automation.

1. They got access to a coveted dataset with vLex that is one of 3 places you can get good US legal data.
2. They got access to an international legal dataset (some would say THE international legal dataset).
3. They dug a mass grave and kicked a bunch of existing products into it - probably want to phrase this better.
4. Since they have both the legal business data (client info, pleadings, discovery, calendar, etc.) AND that good legal research data all in one platform, sky's the limit for automation.  Prompting in their platform is dramatically different because they have that RICH context to drag back-and-forth between those two arenas.
5. They hinted at some background predictive automation.  Even in Salesforce with their background agents, you have to do a lot of set up and tinkering to configure things.  Clio is setting up their system where these will just run for your firm out of the box, or you can set up your own (drag dates out of Orders and put them into your calendar, etc.).

One of the existing problems with a lot of legal tech was that it was siloed or calling low-quality, limited APIs.  By bringing everything into a single system, you are able to do things that would take a lot of time, effort, and money to create on your own (even if you have good APIs).

Then there's the price - go look up what an AMLaw 100 firm pays for each seat for Lexis or Westlaw. 

Clio undercut that by a lot and Clio does a lot more than just legal research. 

Once they overcome the trust issue with secondary materials (not a small hurdle), they're going to capture a lot of the market.

I am in IT specializing in automation and system design. It seems to be a re-occurring trend where small law firms are in the ""dark ages"" when it comes to modern software tools, causing complaints and lost time and lost billable hours. Is this something you lawyers have experienced?

some things I have personally identified that could be useful are:  
\- new client onboarding automated into clio matter  
\- automated communications for case statuses and appointments (emails and texts)  
\- E-signature routing  
\- automated file organization based on client  
\- templatized files that can be generated instantly based on client

nkknw8t,Law,legaltech,"nan You’re completely right small and mid-size firms are usually 5–10 years behind on automation, mostly because the tools that exist are built for enterprise budgets and full IT departments.

From what I’ve seen, the biggest wins don’t come from “AI magic,” but from **structured, human-reviewed automation** for document prep, client intake, and e-sign workflows.

I’ve been helping a few small firms move away from manual templates and endless emails using light workflows that connect Clio, Google Docs, and a few custom scripts.

The result: less data entry, faster turnaround, and no black-box AI risk.

nkord89,Law,legaltech,"nan Biggest wins come from human-reviewed automation around intake, doc gen, e-sign, and calendaring, not AI tricks.

What’s worked for small firms I’ve helped: Typeform or Jotform feeds Zapier, creates a Contact in Clio Grow, then pauses for a manual conflict check task before opening a Matter. Calendly writes to Clio and triggers SMS/email reminders via Twilio or Clio texts, with opt-out and every message logged to the Matter. For documents, Google Docs templates pull Clio custom fields; simple ones go straight to PDF into a Drive folder structure (auto-created per Matter), and anything complex runs through Lawyaw or Gavel for clause logic. For signatures, we tried DocuSign and HelloSign, but SignWell was easiest for sequential routing, reminders, and clean audit trails without extra clicks.

Add a weekly audit report: show Matters missing engagement letters, unsigned docs, and stalled tasks. Biggest pitfalls: duplicate contacts, sloppy permissions on client folders, and texts without consent. The [clauzly.com](http://clauzly.com) example lines up well-ship a small pilot in a sandbox first.

nkqvbgr,Law,legaltech,"nan That’s an incredibly well-structured setup you basically described the sweet spot most small firms should aim for.  
What we’ve seen too is that once that base layer (intake → docgen → e-sign) is stable, the next bottleneck is clause-level visibility knowing *what changed* and *what’s pending review* across documents.

We tackled that by layering lightweight clause tracking and “review checkpoints” on top of the same Clio + Google stack, no AI decision-making involved.  
It keeps humans in control but removes the chaos of version drift.

nkhmi0m,Law,legaltech,"nan I think the fault lies in your concept of who owns the data you're hoping to work with.

Because you're building a system that you plan to sell to law firms, you're thinking this system helps lawyers so the law firm owns the data.

Not true.  The CLIENT owns the data, and the lawyers are merely custodians of that data.  This custodial relationship is governed by rules, laws, and established caselaw and varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

When viewed in this way, having data separated easily helps with say...shipping it over to an expert witness.  Or transferring it to other (or opposing) counsel.  More often these days, it's done in one of a few industry-accepted norms for the format and organization of the data.

And for eDiscovery, you really want to accomodate the time horizon of a case in a methodical way.   Imagine your centralied database solution.   For a firm of say.....25 litigators, you may have up to 1,000 matters in some state at any given time.

nlhn913,Law,legaltech,"nan I've been speaking SQL for about the same amount of time - I actually coded SQL/PHP as a part-time gig while I was in law school 25 years ago. As a pet project, I tried to centralize one corp.'s ediscovery matters, so they could deduplicate privileged documents, run analysis across multiple litigation, etc. It was a nightmare. A document that is privileged in one matter may not be privileged in another matter. Responsiveness would almost never be global - what is responsive to a request for production in one case doesn't have any indication as to its' responsiveness in another matter. (The only exception is general docs - like the employee manual might be produced for all employment matters. But those doc sets are so small they're not worth talking about.) Email threading can't be consolidated - you may not always have all of the same email - it's dependent on custodians, search terms, etc.

Bottom line is that while there is some benefit to consolidating certain things, most ediscovery is still individual by its nature. I've had great luck in streamlining similar caseloads though - so for example, I had a client that is a top retail chain who has their own warehouses. They have ~8 employment matters monthly. I was able to consolidate and streamline a lot of that work so that they can basically spin up an ""employment matter"" workspace in Relativity, that has all of the specs they use for processing and production, all of the documents they consistently produce for these types of matters, specialized indexes, etc., and then all they have to do is add the handful or so docs that are specific to the person who is suing.","['relativity', 'ediscovery']",ive been speaking sql for about the same amount of time i actually coded sqlphp as a parttime gig while i was in law school years ago as a pet project i tried to centralize one corps ediscovery matters so they could deduplicate privileged documents run analysis across multiple litigation etc it was a nightmare a document that is privileged in one matter may not be privileged in another matter responsiveness would almost never be global what is responsive to a request for production in one case doesnt have any indication as to its responsiveness in another matter the only exception is general docs like the employee manual might be produced for all employment matters but those doc sets are so small theyre not worth talking about email threading cant be consolidated you may not always have all of the same email its dependent on custodians search terms etc bottom line is that while there is some benefit to consolidating certain things most ediscovery is still individual by its nature ive had great luck in streamlining similar caseloads though so for example i had a client that is a top retail chain who has their own warehouses they have employment matters monthly i was able to consolidate and streamline a lot of that work so that they can basically spin up an employment matter workspace in relativity that has all of the specs they use for processing and production all of the documents they consistently produce for these types of matters specialized indexes etc and then all they have to do is add the handful or so docs that are specific to the person who is suing,positive

At a mid-sized PI firm (15 attorneys, \~200 active cases) doing evaluations / looking to adopt more technology, and currently looking at lead drop-off. We've demoed a few of these intake agent tools plus, talked to a few peers. Everyone seems to be launching an intake module now

**What we're trying to figure out:**

Lead intake vs. client intake?

It seems to me that most tools pitch ""client intake,"" but we realized they're really solving lead intake. The person calling at 9pm hasn't retained us yet. Are firms actually using these AI agents for signed clients, or is it all pre-retainer triage?

Call center or AI: We've used offshore call centers before (quality was all over the place, cost added up). The AI demos look slick, but are you actually routing all calls? all after-hours calls to these? or just overflow? What's will break? weird accent handling, CRM sync issues?

ROI - the math seems obvious (one extra signed case pays for a month (at least for our firm)), but that assumes the AI actually books the consult and the lead shows up. For people using this, what kind of bump have you actually seen from answered call to signed retainer? Even rough percentages help us understand this better

What the demos don't show - Products have had polished product tours, but I'm curious about the operational stuff. Does it integrate cleanly with our Clio Grow vs. our Manage setup? Any after-hours compliance headachges we might run into?

Is this even a top-3 problem? Honestly not sure if this is where we should be spending time and budget. We track maybe 8-12% of our inbound leads coming after 5pm, but our managing partner thinks case velocity and demand letter backlogs are bigger issues right now. If you tried one of these tools and stopped using it, what was the actual reason?

1. Workflows that are too complex to automate easily (things like collecting evidence, generating drafts, syncing data across Clio, Outlook, etc.)  
2. Tiny recurring tasks that are too small to spend time into (things like sending a happy birthday email to your client, etc.)

1o4n70h,Law,legaltech,"The tech folks have failed lawyers One one hand, I am seeing reports from reputed sources (such as [this](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/legal-tech-market-map/) report from CB Insights) come out and claim that legal tech is receiving a deluge of investment, attention and love.

The central hypothesis being that lawyers are drowning in knowledge work and documents, an ideal environment to go AI-native. Per a [LexisNexis report](https://www.lexisnexis.com/html/lexisnexis-generative-ai-story/), about 47% of lawyers believe that GenAI will fully transform Law, and about 77% believe it'll impact (positively) efficiency in some way. From an anecdotal perspective, people and the media is going crazy about Harvey, Legora, Paxton ... etc. etc.

It makes intuitive sense too. AI systems today are reasoning systems built on top of language systems. So professions like law, accounting, medical billing, insurance etc. stand to gain the most from such systems.

On the other hand, when I visit this and other subreddits, I see lawyers and firms vehemently condemn and reject most legal tech products, even the likes of Harvey and Legora.

My initial impression was that a rebellion is happening. Positing that some tool could automate knowledge work you have studied and practiced years for is ridiculous and degrading. As such, it evokes a rebellious and emotional response.

Now after spending a lot of time scrutinizing many tools, I feel otherwise. I blame the tech folks.

Due to whatever god awful reason there is (I don't want to get into morality, ethics or economics in this post), the tech folks just seem to be enamored with false marketing and over-the-top claims. Claims which can never come true because of the nature of LLMs.

This is not something exclusive to the legal tech industry, but it seems to be especially pronounced here. 

Here's a very bright example: [DoNotPay](https://donotpay.com/) promised to sue for assault without the need of any lawyer and marketed the ability to ""create perfectly valid legal documents in no time"". Obviously, it was all fluff and lies and the FTC was forced to take action against them. 

[Casetext](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/cocounsel) (now known as CoCounsel) was acquired by Thomson Reuters in 2023 for a sky high valuation of $650M on account of a claim that they have reduced their product's hallucinations on legal analysis to ZERO. While it hasn't been disproven, given how LLMs function and are mathematically structured, you know how I feel about this incident.

Because of this, there's consistent backlash on and rejection of any new tools you bring into the market. It doesn't matter what your value prop is (because at the end of the day, it will be one of these [categories](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaltech/comments/1nzf3eu/the_6_categories_of_the_promised_land_of_legal/), so they have seen some version of your product before already and seen it fail).

nly40w7,Law,LawFirm,"nan It works for me in immigration, but mostly because they are cases that can take years to resolve and there are gates/milestones such as filing paperwork or work permits where if they are not up to date I can delay work or withdraw representation. 

For the few minor criminal matters I have done its usually a very big chunk up front and a more compressed payment plan if any. 

I will say that I have two people on staff just for collections and that's how I make it work. The employee costs are covered by what I take in and the clients I would not have had if it were not for the payment plans. If it were just me expecting payment probably less than half would pay on time. 

A lot of it also depends on dialing in your costs and qualifying the client in terms of what you are willing to do. Someone who is living at a shelter and clearly has no job its obviously not going to work and they will need to get friends and family to help with everything or most up front. 

Look into paylater/affirm with Lawpay.

1oi5o7k,Law,LawFirm,"Associate billing policy Hello all,

I am a firm owner with one associate who has been with me for a few years. We do probate and real estate work, with relatively little adversarial litigation. More than half our work is flat fee or “hybrid” for probate (read: flat fee up to the court fee cap, then hourly with application to the court). As of now, I simply assign cases to the associate and she bills and invoices them according to how I’ve usually done things.

Is it unusual for the associate to do their own involving if the matter is flat fee or hybrid? In our probate cases, the rules allow us to seek extraordinary fees if the cases is difficult, which was definitely whiffed by the associate several times. I think the real problem is the lack of firm discipline about keeping accurate time records. 

We currently use Smokeball which has an auto time feature which requires careful review of time to remove duplicates (e.g., if you log “revised draft” today, tomorrow Smokeball will retroactively insert its own duplicate “draft filename reviewed” entry. Great if you forget to log time responding to emails or quick peeks at the file, but tedious if you are trying to keep the time records clean.) For those of you who use Smokeball, how do you deal with this? 

We need to implement some kind of time review system with a deadline for finalizing time records. How is it done in your experience? Is it “get your last week’s time in to the managing partner by Wednesday” or similar?

nlznwgq,Law,LawFirm,"nan The core question seems applicable to the use of any billing platform, Smokeball, Practice Panther, Clio, etc.

A partner should always review billing before it goes out. We are a similarly situated small firm, with both litigation and transactions. Regardless of billing arrangement, the invoicing workflow is the same:
1. Monthly invoicing.
2. Draft bills and statements are reviewed by the attorney working the file, to capture obvious errors and typos. These drafts are generated by a billing assistant who posts all to a shared Sharepoint folder. We get email notice of the folder. The reviewed items kick back to the billing assistant, with comments, instructions to toggle entries to bill/not bill, or to hold really small invoices until next cycle.
3. The business manager then reconciles payments received and retainer balances to be included on each invoice, so that requests to refresh retainers may be timely made. The lawyers aren’t directly involved in this stage.
4. Final invoices are posted, and the responsible partner reviews all (it can feel like a teacher reviewing 50 boring 8th grade essays, but this is how you convert heartbeats to cash, so suck it up).
5. Invoices are electronically delivered via the practice management system, with personalized notes and payment links (through our portal, linked to Law Pay). Lawyers get copied on the transmission in case a client calls with questions.

It is the same rote process, every month. It can run two weeks at the beginning of each month, in the background, as our lawyers continue with substantive work.

Leverage your Bar perks. Fastcase is fine to start - pair it with free secondary sources (Justia, Casetext’s basic tier) for broader search.

Automate paperwork early. I used AI Lawyer to build templates for pleadings, engagement letters, and invoices. Saved hours every week and reduced malpractice risk from copy-paste errors.

Income bridge: advertise Ad Litem and mediation work hard - that recurring local appointment income will stabilize cashflow faster than chasing new clients.

Marketing: get listed on your state Bar’s referral service and make a simple one-page site with clear pricing. Clients in rural areas value clarity over polish.

  
TL:DR - your biggest early win is reducing admin friction. The less time you spend formatting docs or tracking emails, the more time you can spend getting clients. Tools like AI Lawyer let you run a lean, compliant solo shop without the “big firm” overhead.","['clio', 'smokeball']",congrats on taking the leap solo practice in a legal desert is tough but totally doable a few lessons from setting up mine keep your tech stack tiny you dont need cliolevel software out of the gate ai lawyer or smokeball lite can handle your intake templates and esigns for a fraction of the cost leverage your bar perks fastcase is fine to start pair it with free secondary sources justia casetexts basic tier for broader search automate paperwork early i used ai lawyer to build templates for pleadings engagement letters and invoices saved hours every week and reduced malpractice risk from copypaste errors income bridge advertise ad litem and mediation work hard that recurring local appointment income will stabilize cashflow faster than chasing new clients marketing get listed on your state bars referral service and make a simple onepage site with clear pricing clients in rural areas value clarity over polish tldr your biggest early win is reducing admin friction the less time you spend formatting docs or tracking emails the more time you can spend getting clients tools like ai lawyer let you run a lean compliant solo shop without the big firm overhead,positive
nktqp21,Law,LawFirm,"nan This is such a thoughtful post...you’re asking the right questions at the right stage.

I’ve seen a lot of solos make the same leap you’re about to, and the firms that stay afloat early on usually do two things really well:

One..keep systems simple but consistent.

A low-cost tool like Clio Grow Starter or even Notion/Google Workspace can work early, as long as every intake, every follow-up, and every task has a clear home. You don’t need fancy software yet — you need consistency.

Two... well, focus your practice around workflow, not “area.”

Instead of thinking “generalist vs. niche,” think “repeatable vs. custom.” Criminal defense and real estate both have high repeat patterns. If you build good templates and checklists early, you’ll save hundreds of hours.

Fastcase is fine for now, it’ll do 80% of what you need until you scale. The bigger lift is creating a lightweight workflow that tracks deadlines and client comms clearly.

What’s the one task right now that feels most manual or chaotic in your day-to-day?

nkydlp5,Law,LawFirm,"nan \> My first set of questions have to do with keeping expenses low. What are some decent case management softwares to look into that are low cost? 

First off, know that every legal practice manager software is pure shit, user hostile, and will require a steep learning curve. I've tried tons. 

Second, if you don't get training, you've just overpaid for Outlook.

Clio has a very popular base, but it's pricey. I personally use Daylite (MacOS) but I hacked it with Zapier. 

Oh yeah, learn how to use Zapier, it interfaces with most practice managers out there. 

\> Fastcase is included in my Bar memberships. Is this sufficient for legal research, or should I invest in another platform? 

Try it for a bit. It gets the job done, but it's a bicycle. Sometimes you need a truck. 

\> What are some other expenses I need to plan for? 

Technology upgrades. Staffing. Rainy day. CPA. Taxes. 

You're not going to get by with a 10 year old computer. Your home office printer will poop out at the worst possible moment. (This is les of an issue if you have e-filing, but a major issue if you do wet signature intensive stuff, like estate planning.) 

\> I own a small one room office building I built a few years back. 

Smart move. Set up a conference room and a secretarial bay in it. Use it for in person meetings, zoom room for court, etc.

\> I plan to do everything remotely to keep expenses down. 

Double edged sword. If you do estate planning, you'll want face to face meetings. If you have old school clients, you'll want face to face. Some depositions you'll want old school. you might have staff who prefer in person. You have a building, might as well use it. 

\> What are some other investments to start with that could help me?

Unlimited CLE program from NBI. It's cheaper than buying CLE credits for the year, and I use reference materials for research. 

Get a great CPA to go over expenses and see which expenses can be written off. Also, set up a 401 and IRA RIGHT NOW.

1o9mhwq,Law,LawFirm,"*Update* - solo story, 3 years in With several other solo stories popping up this week, I decided it could be worthwhile to others to also give an update. 

Original post, around this time last year - https://www.reddit.com/r/LawFirm/s/LrFOIbhoWQ

Overview - 
- Y1 (not full year) $720k rev. PT to FT paralegal, VA assistance (yes, this number is different from OG post - I must’ve filtered numbers incorrectly last year)
- Y2 $800k rev. FT paralegal, VA assistance (1 to 2 during various points of time). 
- Y3 (YTD, roughly 10 weeks left in the year) $730k YTD; est EOY $950k total. 1 FT paralegal, 2 VAs. 
- Y4 way too early projections - ~$1.4m (same org structure but will be needing to grow staff count + office space at some point for future growth Y5 and beyond)

Just typing these numbers out is surreal. If you didn’t read the OG post, I am not PI - this is mostly flat fee evergreen biz referrals (think debt collection, foreclosures, evictions, RE closings). I can pretty reliably project MoM what the revenue is based on client base and seasonality.

I admittedly work like a dog - no other employed attorneys yet - doing easily 14 hour days while also being very present with family (still taking kids to school, making lunches, cooking dinner). I do use some coverage / contract attorneys but I’d estimate they help with less than 10% of my overall volume annually. 

The biggest things I have really keyed on to supercharge my growth - 

(1) don’t be afraid to ask for business. I had the opportunity, via several litigation cases I handled during a portfolio transfer, to have direct exposure to a large company in-house team. I made it known during litigation updates to them that I would love the opportunity to work with them in the future without being pushy. Roughly a year after those touch points began, they broached me working their matters and ultimately selected my firm for some of their state legal work. 

This one ask literally doubled my monthly revenue  and has supercharged growth further - I am ballpark projecting $1.4m revenue next year based in large part on this growth. 

Yes, it is bananas. I was able to pay in cash for a major house renovation (2000 square feet reno) because of this growth. 

(2) focus on your strengths - don’t be afraid to say no to cases/clients + try to systemize as much of your work as possible. I’ve been reminded of this importance as right before the large new client popped on the horizon, I took on a case type I had handled before (but is not my norm today). Said case has extremely bogged down my capacity and therefore am in process of substituting out of it. 

I also would not be able to handle the volume I do with my lean org without highly systemizing things. I have been trying to find a Zapier consultant who could help automate things within Clio further (HMU if you know anyone)

(3) network within your circle of fellow practitioners. I’ve been able to grow and assume work in part because, on the margin / when I’m stretched, I have local attorneys who will direct 1099 cover hearings for me. I’d like to grow to bring things more in-house for QC and future growth purposes, but the value of having this network is immeasurable (this is also how I’m gracefully transitioning the aforementioned case/client out). I also watch out for other attorneys (small circle in my area) and have developed a positive reputation after saving them at hearings (eg accidental no shows on their part)

At this stage, I am trying to focus next on capturing back more of my time - including adding staff + systemizing and automating things further. I still have eyes for additional growth in an adjacent area to my practice, which would also require office space. Office space would also present a tax write off situation, which taxes are starting to become a very heavy anchor (of course that’s a good problem to have).

A few times a year, I run through my case list of about 80 cases one by one and I make sure everything is moving forward. I have an excel sheet with all my cases and the movement flowchart is something like   
No Fault Insurance Application -> Summons and Complaint -> Make sure answer is in -> Complete Defendant Demands -> schedule and complete depo -> Post Depo demands -> File for trial.

[Gavel.io](http://Gavel.io) (formerly Documate) – low-code legal form builder; you design flows and output PDFs or Word docs. Great for solo/small firms that want to DIY templates.

Combine Word Quick Parts + Excel data source + Power Automate if you want a free option. It’s clunky but works for standardized pleadings.  
Use Google Apps Script + Google Docs to mimic merge fields for shared teams.  
3)Practical setup advice:  
Keep your variable names consistent across all templates (case\_caption, judge\_name, service\_list).  
Use separate templates for caption pages vs main pleadings - easier maintenance.  
Test automation on low-risk forms first (RFPs, subpoenas) before full motions.

nmfka3g,Construction,Construction,"nan Self performing painting while GCing everything else can work but it creates weird dynamics. You're both the contractor managing subs and a trade working alongside them. Our contractors who tried this found that subs sometimes don't take direction as seriously when you're also swinging a brush. Keep those roles clear or it gets messy.

For vetting subs, references are nice but actually working with them on smaller stuff first tells you way more. Give new subs trial runs on punch list work or smaller TI jobs before handing them a critical path item on a $200k project. Also check their insurance and licensing obsessively because one uninsured sub can sink your whole company if something goes wrong.

Contract wise, use AIA subcontract templates modified for your state. Don't try to write your own from scratch. For project management, Procore or Buildertrend work well for TI scale work. They're not cheap but way better than trying to coordinate everything through email and spreadsheets.

Your first few projects will teach you that cash flow is brutal in commercial work. You're paying subs on 30 day terms but getting paid by clients on 45-60 days with retainage held. Line of credit is basically mandatory or you'll be broke waiting on receivables even when projects are profitable.

Change orders are where you make or lose money on TI work. Clients always want modifications once they see the space taking shape. Have a clear change order process with pricing established before doing any extra work. Our customers who let scope creep happen without formal COs ended up doing tons of free work.

For scaling, don't try to jump from 2 projects to 10 projects overnight. Your systems will break and quality will tank. Add capacity gradually and make sure your project management processes actually work before taking on more volume. Hire a solid PM or superintendent before you hire more field labor.

Also understand that Seattle commercial market is competitive as hell right now. Your painting background helps with differentiation but you're competing against established TI contractors with deeper sub relationships and bonding capacity. Focus on smaller projects where relationships matter more than just low price.

For those who’ve gone through a similar seasonal layoff — how did you manage financially during the off months?
 
Did you take on part-time work, remote gigs, or short-term contracts? Any tips for getting something steady (even if temporary) during the winter would be awesome.
 
I’ve started learning drafting software like Civil 3D and Revit to improve my skills — maybe I can find some remote drafting work or freelance projects, but I’m not sure where to start.

nmlgd5v,Tech,sysadmin,"nan Stuff to think about:

 - You and coworkers must know Windows to run all the VMs, do any of you have Linux experience to deal with ProxMox?

 - Your backup, monitoring, patching, remote management, etc. tools - do they work with ProxMox or Hyper-V? If not, are you willing to change them?

 - Does your management need vendor/consultant/MSP support? VMWare and Windows are more widely known that ProxMox, but do your preferred suppliers support one or the other?

 - Are you planning any move to Linux VMs or AWS cloud in future and want to be moving away from Windows? Or are you on M365 and Azure and staying with Windows long term?

 - Window Server Datacenter license covers unlimited VMs, so if you already have that to cover the VMs on each host, it might cover you for Hyper-V on the host at no extra cost. If you don't have it, moving to Hyper-V might mean expensive licensing changes. (Or it might mean licensing savings compared to what you have now if you've got one standard license for each VM, who knows).

 - there's nothing like VMware vCenter builtin to Windows to give a single cluster management. System Center / SCVMM is the Microsoft way, but it's another licensing cost and another complex thing to setup and deal with. Without that you're using Hyper-V console, PowerShell, Windows Admin Center, Failover Cluster Manager, which works but is annoying.

 - ProxMox does give a web GUI cluster management interface over KVM virtual machines, and it might be better for that reason alone. If you and coworkers do have Linux experience, don't have Windows Datacenter licensing, and your backup system does work with ProxMox, that makes it a very strong option.

 - I have experience with VMware and Hyper-V, and Linux generally but none with ProxMox.

1olwrty,Tech,sysadmin,"SSH with pubkey accidentally left opened. Any issue? I normally check the server security carefully, but finally made a mistake.

When I create servers in cloud, the firewall is enabled and only 443 is allowed, which I usually also manually remove. No allow rules, no incoming traffic. This is the default behavior in my provider.

I changed the cloud provider, and didn’t notice that the default behavior is different: if there are no rules in dashboard, it means everything is allowed by default. The UI is different. Somehow I didn’t catch it in my test.

On VM, ufw default is block all incoming except SSH. SSHD is configured correctly with a custom sshd\_config to allow only public key authentication and nothing else.

I noticed the issue, and found tens of thousands of failed connection attempts. Logs on the same server show nothing was accepted other than with my public key and IP.

Is there any concern?

Should the server be deleted? It takes a lot of work.

We’ve got “multi-AZ everything”, backups, health checks, all the standard playbook stuff. But that’s still all inside one provider. Once you start asking “what if IAM or S3 or DNS in that region stops working?” it gets ugly fast.

Turns out half our “redundant” systems depend on the same control plane or managed service anyway. Even our monitoring stack isn’t as isolated as we thought.

Curious how other teams handle this:
	•	Do you actually simulate provider/region outages, or just hope it never happens?

	•	How do you figure out what’s truly single-point vs redundant?

	•	Anyone built good visibility around this without going full multi-cloud?

It's the same docker image and the same docker network, the only difference is the isolation type.

- Creating new nat docker network didn't help
- Ping and tracert shows no issues
- Disabling Firewall on the host didn't help
- Disabling NetAdapterRSC according to [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-Containers/issues/145) didn't help
- Sniffing traffic with wireshark on the host didn't show anything except ARP and DNS packets.
- Microsoft Azure VFP Switch Filter Extension on Default Switch in Hyper-V manager is already disabled, though it can't be anbled for some reason. Might be relevant?

nmjuj7t,Tech,sysadmin,"nan The only thing I appreciate with this is including the build number in the title, which I noticed they started doing for Server 2025 Security updates around July. Does this mean they're including them for other Server OS versions as well.  
  
You're probably asking 'why?' and that's because before this I had written a script that 1) gets the latest update for each Server OS pushed via WSUS 2) downloads the .cab 3) extracts the update.mum which is essentially a manifest in xml 4) reads the manifest to get the build number 5) uploads these values to a .txt file on an Azure Storage Blob. Then we can use this .txt in a Log Analytics Query to see which servers are behind on patches easily (we have the Azure Arc agent on all hosts).  
  
We find MECM reporting isn't always 100% reliable, and often times this has caught 1-4 hosts slipping through our other compliance reporting methods. Consider that a lot of methods (like SoftwareUpdate CMPivot query) are dependent on the Windows Update Agent local to the host seeing an applicable update from WSUS where Is installed=0. Then consider all the cases where that may return nothing due to misconfig, firewall blocking, etc.

We’re looking at piloting Azure Entra’s new Source of Authority (SOA) conversion feature and wanted to hear from anyone who’s already tried it.
For those unfamiliar: it’s the feature that lets you transfer user/group management from on-prem AD to Entra ID without deleting and recreating objects. 

It uses the isCloudManaged attribute to tell sync tools to stop syncing specific objects while maintaining identities and relationships.

Specifically curious about:

	•	How smooth was the actual conversion process? Any gotchas?
	•	Did you run into issues with on-prem app access after conversion?
	•	How are you handling Kerberos-based applications? (Application Proxy, Cloud Kerberos Trust, or something else?)
	•	Any problems with group provisioning back to AD after conversion?
	•	What’s your device situation? (Entra joined, hybrid joined, etc.)
	•	Would you recommend it, or are there hidden pain points Microsoft’s docs don’t cover?
	•	How it might impact mail enabled accounts?

nmgbqgy,Tech,sysadmin,"nan Not fired but yes, I’ve been pushed to the point where staying was just not tenable - a few times. 

Most recent was a company that had a huge data breach early in the year and drafted me in to try and fix some of their problems. 

First up, zero documentation. So trying to get my head around their stack was a constant grind of asking repeated questions and getting no answers. vague hand-waving and buck-passing were the norm. 

The “devops” team were doing everything by hand and what little devops-related code existed was generated by chatgpt, didn’t really work and wasn’t source-controlled. All deployments are manual copy/paste and clickops, which does not scale and makes changing anything a grind.

Then came refusals for extra budget, even though their app was constantly struggling for resources and failing almost daily. I had to fight to get two new EC2 instances approved and there was whining from management about the AWS bill going up even by <10%.

Eventually it emerged that the reason they’d had a breach was simple SQL injection. The team of “very talented seniors” had actually been just casually passing SQL queries around in post bodies and query strings for years as if that wasn’t an utterly insane thing to do. Icing on the cake: they kept on doing it and just had the WAF configured to allow some types of queries but not others.

Not long after all this I found a misconfiguration in the WAF they’d dropped in after the breach that meant it was possible (actually fairly easy) to completely bypass their minimal SQLi protections. I wrote it up in detail but they dragged their feet on signing off budget to fix it and from there it just became a countdown to when I’d walk out. 

It took about three weeks. I didn’t have another role lined up but it was too much.

1okl7op,Tech,sysadmin,"My whole IAM is messed up — need advice on how to clean this up and build best practices Hey folks,

I’m in a bit of an IAM (Identity & Access Management) nightmare.

Here’s the setup:

Workday is our HR source of truth.

Entra (Azure AD) pulls from Workday, applies some expressions, and creates users in on-prem AD.

AD then syncs back to Entra ID — that’s for all internal employees, internal contractors, etc.

Meanwhile, all externals, 3rd party vendors, functional/service accounts are managed through MIM (Microsoft Identity Manager).


The problem:
Everything feels disconnected. Sometimes a user is terminated in Workday, but the end date doesn’t sync properly, so the AD and Entra accounts stay active. We end up with orphaned accounts or inconsistencies across systems.

It’s becoming a governance and audit nightmare.

So I’m looking for advice, tools, or best practices on how to:

Clean this whole thing up

Establish proper lifecycle management across HR, AD, Entra, and MIM

Detect and deprovision stale or mismatched accounts automatically

Possibly simplify this whole architecture (if that’s even possible)


Has anyone been through a similar mess and come out sane?
What tools or design patterns worked for you (SailPoint, Saviynt, Entra Lifecycle, custom PowerShell/Logic Apps, etc.)?

nmbuwr4,Tech,sysadmin,"nan We don't use MIM. Haven't heard of the name in years. Didn't know it's still around. Anyway...here's what I have in my environment. 

* Workday has an ability to generate Raas as CSV. They can customize many fields. In addition to normal data like names and title, we uses ""Hire Date"", ""Start Date"", ""End Date"", ""Term Date""
   * Hire Date - When user appears in Workday, but not yet start. Prep period. Create AD, email, etc. 
   * Start Date - When AD becomes active. Groups added. MFA registered. etc. 
   * Term Date - When AD account becomes disabled, groups removed, etc. Normal leaver process.
   * End Date - Same as Term Date. But for HR to keep the account active in Workday for PTO and other back office processing. We don't really care about this field.
* With RaaS, we get 2-3 different version of files. New hire reports (future 14 days), Current report (for changes like name, title, manager, etc., and Term report (7 days report).
* Task scheduler, or any scheduler tool your company may have to runs the script hourly/daily. 
* Then the rest is normal AD > EntraID Sync > Azure runbook/Dynamic groups > etc. 
* We get the files through SFTP. A bit convoluted and involved a lot of teams to get the workflow going. 
* If anything goes wrong... 9 out of 10 incidents were due to files issue or SFTP issue. Not IAM. 
   * We do have sanity check of the files to make sure no bad actors suddenly remove the whole department.
   * Any priv account is marked with extension attribute to make sure the script never target it. Script is only for human account.

There are no VPN's, you can brand their interface or even have per-client custom branding, the whole thing is very secure because it does a reverse proxy through the outbound FW port and everything goes over an Azure backbone so the connection piggy backs off of Microsoft infrastructure instead of going over the public internet. 

They handle all the certificate signing for the RDP connections and the web parts of the whole story, so that's another headache less. 

Also there are custom URLs for logins if you prefer to do it over web, but you can also install their app (also branded) and add your app to the user desktops via Desktop shortcuts, which avoids re-authenticating.

nmellvv,Tech,sysadmin,"nan This is an almost *textbook-perfect* use case for NetFoundry/OpenZiti (openziti.io), as they deliver zero-trust, identity-aware access, authenticate-before-connect, without requiring a full re-architecture or exposure of public endpoints. 

By embedding NetFoundry/Ziti overlay into your product, the RDS environment becomes completely invisible to the internet - no open ports, DMZs, or VPN gateways - while users still connect seamlessly and securely. This instantly eliminates the biggest attack surface for RDP environments and aligns the deployment with a zero-trust model, all without disrupting existing workflows.

Unlike traditional VPNs, NF/Ziti provides app-specific, E2E encrypted connectivity that routes traffic directly between authorised users and the internal service. That design keeps latency low and removes dependency on third-party POPs, which is particularly beneficial for interactive protocols like RDP. Access policies are defined at the application level rather than by IP or subnet, enforcing who can reach which service - a cleaner, more scalable approach to segmentation and control. While NetFoundry provides its own PKI (or BYO), it also works with Entra ID (Azure AD), or any other OIDC/x509 provider, enabling single sign-on, MFA, and Conditional Access for RDS users. This brings modern Microsoft 365 identity management to a legacy on-prem platform without needing to adopt Azure Virtual Desktop or Citrix. Combined with its open architecture and self-hosting options, NetFoundry gives organisations complete control of their connectivity and security posture while avoiding vendor lock-in or high per-user subscription costs (note, OpenZiti is fully open source if that's the preference).

In short, NetFoundry transforms a legacy RDS deployment into a secure, cloud-ready service that feels modern to users and safe to administrators - zero-trust, identity-driven, and built for incremental modernisation rather than a disruptive overhaul.

nmc7b88,Tech,sysadmin,"nan It sounds like you're wanting to do something like federate your Azure AD to for RDS use . This should be very achievable

The options you mention of Azure virtual desktop or  Citrix don't make much sense

The RDS server is just a resource on the network. It's accessed via the RDP protocol. You have some fancy manuverring going on to make it work with RDS Gateway and RDWEB, it's not too fancy but a little

Thing is, it's still simply accessible the Remote Desktop session. Your application is simply a resource running on that session

It sounds like ideally you want to totally revamp the application but that solution is no where in your near future so something like RDS ( your current solution) is a great option

With Azure desktops you're dealing with the exact same setup the only difference is that your machine, your compute system which you're now paying a lot of money for to Azure for it even being up is in the Azure cloud. It's the same setup you have now only different manuverring to get the user to the session

Citrix on the other hand could refer to an lot of things. I'm not sure if you're making reference to whatever they now call the Netscaler device, likely you're not speaking of that but rather the add on to Windows to use their HDX aka ICA protocol instead of RDP. 

The underlying system is still exactly the same. Citrix on Windows session host is setup exactly as Remote Desktop you know why? Because it is in fact Remote Desktop. 

Worded differently, unless you have some very specific reason to add Citrix to the mix because it offers some features that are not currently available to you, it would be foolish to do so. Waste of money too 

Keep in mind my roles now have little to do with this technology anymore but I was there in the early days of this at Microsoft and after. 

I can't tell you off hand which exact knob to turn but I'll tell you you're extremely close to where you need to be already. Likely a lot of ways to meet your goals.

Keep in mind that Microsoft 365 is simply an application sitting in Azure and the thing that used to be called Azure Active Directory is what it authenticates to

1oki9cm,Tech,sysadmin,"WSUS Replacement Needed! Domain-Joined Org with 1600+ Endpoints - What are you using for Windows Update Management? Hey r/sysadmin,

We're an organization with a global footprint (1400 domain-joined computers across the world, and 200 servers in our virtual environment) and we've finally reached the point where we need to move on from WSUS. Its limitations, especially with remote/global endpoints and lack of seamless third-party patching, are becoming a major headache.

Our entire environment is still **fully domain-joined** (Active Directory), and while we are exploring options like Azure Arc for our servers (I posted separately on that), we need a comprehensive solution that handles both our servers and our 1400+ client computers globally.

We are looking for a robust, scalable solution to manage all Windows updates (OS and third-party) for our desktops/laptops and servers.

I'd love to hear what products your organizations are using as a modern replacement for WSUS. Specifically, we're focused on these key areas:

1. **Product Suggestions:** What are the absolute best products you've used for managing updates on a large scale for both Windows computers and servers? (e.g., NinjaOne, Automox, ManageEngine, Action1, Ivanti, etc.)
2. **The Microsoft Path (Intune/MEM):** Given that we are fully domain-joined, what is the recommended Intune pathway?
   * Is it **Co-Management** (SCCM/MECM + Intune) for a gradual migration?
   * Can we effectively manage all updates (including WaaS/WUfB) on our domain-joined clients via **Hybrid Azure AD Join** and Intune alone?
   * what is the cost to manage updates via Intune (License per user/computer)?
3. **Deployment/Connectivity:** How does the solution handle our global, remote workforce?
   * Is it a purely **cloud-based agent** that manages updates over the internet (no VPN needed)?
   * Does it still require a **VPN connection** to a central server/data center to pull or report on updates?
   * Does it use Peer-to-Peer (P2P) distribution (like Delivery Optimization) to save on bandwidth at remote sites?
4. **Licensing/Cost:** What is the typical cost model? Is it per-device/per-endpoint, or is it a flat fee/unlimited for domain-joined machines? (Our scale is about 1600 total devices).

Our goal is a product/approach that simplifies management, improves compliance, and effectively patches remote endpoints without needing them to be on the VPN.

Any and all suggestions, war stories, and advice on the best modern approach would be hugely appreciated!

1okdl2d,Tech,sysadmin,"MSP recommended syncing entire AD org to Entra — we’re only syncing user OU. Thoughts? Our MSP recently suggested we sync our entire on-prem AD organization to Microsoft Entra ID (via Azure AD Connect). Their reasoning was simplicity and future-proofing. But we’ve held off and are currently syncing only the OU that contains actual user accounts.

Here’s why:

• 	We use Exchange Online, so syncing mail-enabled users is necessary.

• 	We assign Microsoft 365 licenses, and syncing only the relevant OU keeps the licensing dashboard clean.

• 	We don’t want service accounts, disabled users, or legacy objects cluttering Entra or triggering compliance noise.

I get the appeal of full sync — no filtering, fewer surprises — but it feels messy and unnecessary for our setup. Especially when selective sync gives us more control and less overhead.

If I copy the files out, I can indeed ""unlock"" the file, but I'm no more able to launch them nor copy them back to sys32.

It's the first time I encounter this issues, and after hours of deep searching I still feel nowhere close to a solution to this.

Known issues / fixes / ideas?

We're on a Win Server with AD domain, and in the migration process I've already disconected and reconected to the domain.

Please do ask for details as required. If I start listing everything nobody would read it. Anything relevent will make it back here.

1olo2uc,Tech,msp,"Feasibility of a one-man developer turned MSP? I'm a software engineer with 15 years of experience. Outside of work I enjoyed having my own small reseller hosting business on WHM/CPanel/Open SRS/enom. It was fun for a while to host some mom and pop websites and make a few bucks but it wasn't really that profitable even though I still kind of enjoyed it. Eventually I shut that down and just moved all of my customers under a GoDaddy reseller plan so they could still have customer support through a white label site and now whenever friends or family hit up the techie guy for a website I just throw them on there with a website builder plan - quick, fast, and minimal involvement for me as well as a few dollars for the one or two questions they may ask me a year. 

Anyways, I've been doing a lot of contracting work at $100 and $130 per hour. Business has been good overall but I'm considering starting my own MSP. I'm not sure if I'm using the term in the correct sense but basically I get the feeling there are a lot of small to medium businesses out there that need out of the box solutions/configuration/support when it comes to technology. I'm not sure I really want to offer a complete IT back office because I'm not sure how much I would enjoy that.  I lightly managed an azure tenant but I don't know that I would want to deal with requests all the time. 

My idea is to take popular open source software, host it in docker containers for customers, do backups, and just keep it online in general for monthly fee. I was thinking for business applications charging a couple hundred dollars per month per application. The value add to the business is they get software with unlimited usage instead of using some cloud version that restricts you on arbitrary usage. So basically it's kind of a niche approach to what I used to do years ago with reseller hosting but just more targeted towards businesses and hosting the applications they need instead of just giving them raw servers or domain names to play with.

You're charging them for the use of a ""hosted business application"", but you're basing your pricing on VM resources. That naturally leads to the question of what are you selling? Are you selling a SaaS solution, or are you selling an IaaS solution?

It's nice that you're doing this at a reasonable and inexpensive price. And you can still do that. But the moment you say that it's ""unlimited"" number of users, you are negating any ability for your pricing to scale with their demands.

nmiwngo,Tech,msp,"nan I'm a little confused as you said 'prospects' at first and 'clients' later.  However assuming you mean clients...

I think you misunderstand how good MSP's work.  At the end of the day, we are solid advocates and tech leaders helping customers keep their technology in alignment with (and hopefully slightly ahead of) the needs of the client's business.  That said, as we uncover needs we present and discuss them - with benefits and costs analyzed - and propose a place for it on a multi-year strategic plan.  Then, via regular executive meetings, refine those ideas and strategies until they become real proposals and eventual live projects for implementation. 

We dont ever run 'marketing campaigns' as it were against our current customers.  We also may prefer Microsoft but we do have Google workspace and AWS as well.  If it works for the customer and meets the need we don't recommend away from those platforms unless there is a compelling reason to do so.  But it needs to be a business reason - not just because it makes things easier for us.

All of that said, however, we only have so many staff and so many best practices.  Things can't get too out of alignment otherwise the rest of our stack doesn't work, or we dont have people skilled in that particular technology.  So it does occasionally mean that if the customer wants to keep using us, they need to change.  Otherwise they may need to change their IT provider.

nmdr2ce,Tech,msp,"nan The problem is standardization. Not within one client but within all clients. Yeah I probably could find some small client who primarily uses web apps and set them up on a Linux system, charge them little, but literally never have a complaint from them. But for starters that requires that I as the MSP have a couple of employees who are so well trained on that environment that they can fix issues when they occur and in my time with MSPs churn was shockingly high. 

As an MSP to deal with high churn I essentially want everything I can control to remain constant. I want all my clients using one ecosystem with consistent networking equipment and so on. True, it won't ever be perfect but the closer I can get to that the better. 

Plus the whole thing becomes a hassle the day some new employee at the client claims they need some software with no Linux support. Sure on my personal machine I can probably find a solution and have the patience to use wine or something to wrap it and maybe do my own updates but that is a lot harder to convince a client to do. Inevitably some new accountant or something will come in and ask them to get whatever tool they are used to on there and it becomes more hassle than it is worth unless I can convince the client to stick with what they have.

I still think Linux is the better solution. If I was a company owner I would probably issue laptops with Linux in one form or another to all my employees. It would be great!

nmbwxrb,Tech,msp,"nan # The Core Story

A Dutch IT provider (MSP) was managing a Microsoft Azure environment for one of its SME clients. This MSP bought its cloud services through an ICT distributor, who in turn bought from Microsoft.

* **The Breach:** In late 2022, a cybercriminal gained access to the client's Azure tenant.
* **The Cause:** An investigation showed that the **MSP had disabled Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for the tenant's admin accounts.
* **The Damage:** The hacker created about 60 cloud servers and ran crypto-mining operations at full capacity for **five weeks** before it was detected.
* **The Bill:** The total cost for the consumption came to **€864,000 (approx. $930,000 USD)**.

# The Lawsuit and The Verdict

The MSP's insurance refused to cover the damage. The MSP then took its upstream **ICT distributor** to court, making two main arguments:

1. The distributor failed its ""duty of care"" by not sufficiently warning them about the necessity of MFA.
2. The distributor failed to monitor consumption and should have alerted the MSP to the ""unusual"" activity much sooner.

**The Court's Verdict:** The court ruled **100% against the MSP**. The judge found that the distributor *had* sent emails back in 2020 about Microsoft making MFA mandatory.

Crucially, the court stated that the MSP, as the direct IT provider, is **solely responsible for the IT management and security configurations** of its end-users.

The MSP is now liable for the entire €864,000 bill, plus an additional €39,000 in legal costs.

# Key Discussion Points from the Community

The local comment section on this article was very active. Besides the obvious (and justified) criticism of the MSP for disabling MFA, a few more nuanced points were raised that are highly relevant to us:

* **The ""Safety Net"" Problem:** While everyone agrees the MSP is at fault, many questioned the ""duty of care"" for the entire supply chain. Why do distributors and Microsoft themselves not have better **automatic safety nets**? A €22,000/day spending spike should trigger automatic shutdowns or, at a minimum, much harder alerts. There's a feeling that the platform should have better ""fraud detection"" to prevent a bill from exploding this way.
* **The Licensing ""Trap"":** A very sharp point was made about Microsoft's licensing model. Often, **essential security features** (like full Conditional Access) that could prevent these breaches are **locked behind premium licenses** (P1/P2, E5, etc.). This puts MSPs in a terrible position: we are held 100% liable for security, but we have to fight with clients to get them to pay extra for what should be ""basic"" security features.
* **A Dangerous Legal Precedent?** This was the most interesting takeaway. This verdict establishes that the MSP is responsible for implementing ""basic security."" But what *legally* defines ""basic security""? Does this verdict mean that if Microsoft decides a new, more expensive ""E7"" license is the new ""standard,"" MSPs are automatically liable for any breach on a cheaper plan? It creates a difficult legal position for us when clients inevitably refuse to pay for constant, expensive upgrades.",['azure'],the core story a dutch it provider msp was managing a microsoft azure environment for one of its sme clients this msp bought its cloud services through an ict distributor who in turn bought from microsoft the breach in late a cybercriminal gained access to the clients azure tet the cause an investigation showed that the msp had disabled multifactor authentication mfa for the tets admin accounts the damage the hacker created about cloud servers and ran cryptomining operations at full capacity for five weeks before it was detected the bill the total cost for the consumption came to approx usd the lawsuit and the verdict the msps insurance refused to cover the damage the msp then took its upstream ict distributor to court making two main arguments the distributor failed its duty of care by not sufficiently warning them about the necessity of mfa the distributor failed to monitor consumption and should have alerted the msp to the unusual activity much sooner the courts verdict the court ruled against the msp the judge found that the distributor had sent emails back in about microsoft making mfa mandatory crucially the court stated that the msp as the direct it provider is solely responsible for the it management and security configurations of its endusers the msp is now liable for the entire bill plus an additional in legal costs key discussion points from the community the local comment section on this article was very active besides the obvious and justified criticism of the msp for disabling mfa a few more nuanced points were raised that are highly relevant to us the safety net problem while everyone agrees the msp is at fault many questioned the duty of care for the entire supply chain why do distributors and microsoft themselves not have better automatic safety nets a day spending spike should trigger automatic shutdowns or at a minimum much harder alerts theres a feeling that the platform should have better fraud detection to prevent a bill from exploding this way the licensing trap a very sharp point was made about microsofts licensing model often essential security features like full conditional access that could prevent these breaches are locked behind premium licenses pp e etc this puts msps in a terrible position we are held liable for security but we have to fight with clients to get them to pay extra for what should be basic security features a dangerous legal precedent this was the most interesting takeaway this verdict establishes that the msp is responsible for implementing basic security but what legally defines basic security does this verdict mean that if microsoft decides a new more expensive e license is the new standard msps are automatically liable for any breach on a cheaper plan it creates a difficult legal position for us when clients inevitably refuse to pay for constant expensive upgrades,positive
nm2ggz6,Tech,msp,"nan Congrats on taking the leap! That’s a big move and honestly the best decision you’ll make long term.

Here’s what worked for us when we had zero client network to start with:

* **Start local and visible.** Offer free lunch-and-learns or workshops for small businesses (accounting firms, dental offices, real estate brokers). It positions you as the “local IT guy who actually knows his stuff.”
* **Build relationships before selling.** Don’t cold pitch right away, connect on LinkedIn, comment on local business pages, and join your Chamber of Commerce or local BNI. The referrals that come from *trust first* are gold.
* **Document everything you do.** Even if you don’t have clients yet, post small wins, “Setting up a new firewall for a local firm,” “Testing new monitoring tools,” etc. It builds credibility fast.
* **Pick one service to lead with.** Instead of offering 20 things, focus on a strong entry point like “cybersecurity assessments” or “O365 management.” Easier to explain, easier to sell.

It’s all about small wins early on, one client leads to a referral, and before you know it, you’re turning down work.

1oim487,Tech,msp,"Looking for feedback on service offering I have setup a cybersecurity company that offers managed cybersecurity services and various consultancy services. I believe the services are most effective when delivered via a partnered MSP, although the services are offered direct to the client if the client has an internal technical team. 

While I have been speaking to several MSPs and have 20 or so years' experience within MSP/MSSP environments, I’m seeking some input from a wider audience now that it’s operational. The company is based in NZ and is primarily aimed at providing services to AUS/NZ at this stage.

**Goal**

* Provide tailored cybersecurity solutions without the complexity.
* We provide the required tooling and handle everything from configurations through to incident response.
* We handle the alerts and only escalate those that require action from the client or MSP. We do not expect our clients or the MSP to triage alerts.
* Provide actionable report output that leads to improved security posture when accompanied by a proactive technical team.
* Provide clients with transparency around our internal roadmap and taking on feedback to help shape our services.
* Provide all-inclusive services with predictable pricing structure (roughly $34 NZD per user)

**Core Services**

The core stack is made up of a combination of fully managed services which are tailored to the clients’ requirements and not offered as options. I have chosen to bundle services so that clients have decent coverage according to their specific environment and remove complexity associated with service options and pricing.

* 24x7 Security Operations Center
* Attack Surface Monitoring
* Endpoint Detection & Response
* Identity Threat Detection & Response
* Mail Filtering
* Microsegmentation (Critical Assets only)
* Security Awareness Training
* Secure Remote Access
* Curated Threat Intelligence

As part of the service, my team covers everything related to the security tooling, this includes:

* Alert Triage
* Incident Response
* Configuration
* Tuning
* Remediation

Alert Triage & Incident Response is included in the pricing, though this is with the assumption that we can manage configuration/tuning and that the recommended security stack is in place. If clients want more control, we offer another bundle that includes all services with the exception of Alert Triage/Incident response hours, and time is instead billed at a reduced hourly rate over and above the standard per user rates.

We also include monthly reporting that is focused on providing actionable output that can be used to improve the client’s security posture over time, this is where I see the most benefit for partnerships with a MSP, since this output can directly feed into client roadmaps which the MSP manage for the client. Our reports are compliance-focused, starting with SMB1001 and extending to others to address gaps (we don’t just report on the number of events we handled during the report period).

**Optional Services**

In addition to the core services, I also offer the following managed services that are not included in the standard bundle:

* Breach & Attack Simulation
* Managed Firewall (Selected brands only)
* Micro-segmentation
* Password Management
* SIEM
* WAF
* ZTNA

All products used in the stack are specifically chosen by my company, they are industry-leading products that have been proven to be highly effective in production and not only in Gartner.

I am looking for feedback from MSPs and the details in this post should provide a brief description about what we are trying to achieve.

* Would you consider such a service to be beneficial to MSPs who wish to leverage external security services?
* Do you see any gaps that you think should be covered by us? If so, please provide your reasoning.
* Any other feedback is welcome :)

They formed a Holding Company to manage us and the new company decided to use our existing IT instead of creating their own. Great, now we have a completely separate Azure tenant and users with their own hardware requirements. Also to note, only the Infrastructure Manager has any access to their systems and he rarely responds to tickets as he's focussed on our Windows 11 rollout.
One day, while the helpless manager was on paternity leave, one if them passes a ticket into my queue that just says ""User cannot connect to wireless. Passing to 2nd Line as I can't remote onto their PCs""
I immediately bounce the ticket back with a note saying ""Passing back to 1st line to perform basic wireless troubleshooting.""
Went to grab a coffee and came back to find the ticket still in my queue, no notes added. Thinking I had forgotten to reassign the ticket properly. I set it to 1st Line and hit save.
Two minutes later, ticket in my queue again, no notes. Checked the activity log and can see the 1st line guy has just bounced it right back. Added another note telling him what to check, wifi turned on, anyone else having issues, checked with the office IT if their had been changes to network (They're in a pleased office and rely on the guest wifi) etc.
2 minutes later, ticket back in my queue, no notes.
Getting pissed now, I add another note, all caps and in bold. ""DO NOT PASS THIS TICKET BACK TO 2ND LINE WITHOUT ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS IN THE PREVIOUS NOTE.""
2 minutes later. You guessed it, ticket back in 2nd line queue, no notes.
At this point I just stand up, walk to his desk, lean over and tell him, very calmly but firmly. ""If that wireless ticket goes back in my queue again with no troubkeshooting, you and I are going to have words.""

1o24l9q,Tech,talesfromtechsupport,"How I found out we hadn't finished deploying the content filter As I'm sure we all experienced, COVID forced a work from home policy that strained not just work procedures, but how IT works as well. 

So with WFH, we needed a content filter solution on the computers instead of just the corporate firewall. We deploy it, configure it, done... or so we thought. 

Some time later, a coworker messages me and says they found a problem on our website. They know I'm not on the web team, but could I help them prepare a ticket with the right terms to get it treated faster? This user always opens good, respectful tickets, so of course I help! Techs looking out for techs!

So we start a screen share session and we're preparing the ticket for the web team. My coworker then tries to describe a feature that should be on the website, says ""this is how it is on <product>'s website"" and just types product.com.

Well, product.com was full of ladies definitely not using the product my coworker was describing. A few flustered seconds later we got the tab closed, and I showed them how to clear the last hour of browser history. We discovered the product in question is at companyproduct.com and we immediately knew why.

We got the ticket finished and sent off to the web team. I then went and looked at the device web filter and found that we had somehow put exceptions in place without actually picking any categories to block! So exceptions to nothing were configured. 

I sent a screenshot of no blocked categories to the coworker and they replied with the life of crime they would have led with their work computer had they knew the content filter wasn't working.

Microsoft wants Azure domain to be ubiquitous in enterprise.  Azure allows Bitlocker keys to be cloud stored, so your drives are fully encrypted.  That goes hand-in-hand with OneDrive,where all files are stored in a enterprise-controlled cloud location. That way, your organization maintains control of important data when a laptop inevitably goes missing.

TPM 1.0 was cracked in 2017.  That's why TPM 2.0 is required, for Bitlocker encryption.

Bitlocker must be rolled out in order to encrypt every drive, and end users must save all documents in OneDrive.  Then, should a laptop go missing, no data has been lost, it's all in the cloud. 

Outside of enterprise, using a Microsoft account does essentially the same thing without the Azure instance.

Sometime in the early 2000s, I was 11 or 12 years old, and fresh off my parents' divorce, which meant I had a lot of unsupervised time with the family computer, a decent connection, and some suspect PtP networks.  Expectedly, I ended up fucking up the computer at my dad's house.  

Like most tweens doing questionable shit, I wanted to get this resolved before my dad found out, so I called Dell support.  Support runs me through some basic troubleshooting steps to no avail.  Eventually the tech pauses and asks, ""is your computer behind a firewall?""  I'm pretty sure we still had DSL at the time, but I do know this was before the concept of a firewall in home computing was ubiquitous and I wasn't privy.  So, I ask the tech how I would know and he says something like, ""oh, you would know, it's kinda obvious.""

So, my dumbass gets up and looks at the wall the computer was against.  I then went around the corner to look at the wall profile, and then the back side of the wall.  I tell the tech something like, ""I'm not sure; it looks like a regular wall to me.""

I can't remember what the outcome of the call was, but thinking about that moment it kinda blows my mind that people now pay me to configure enterprise phone systems.

Start working on your resume, and your LinkedIn profile.  
Visit your university's career services center and start asking about internships, Co-Op opportunities, and Career Development Programs.  

You need to become the most well-informed person in your friend-group on the subject of internships in technology.  

Career Services offers workshops in resume creation, and interview skills. Sign up for both, and put effort into both.  

Identify and join every single technology-related club on campus. Attend at least 2-3 meetings of each one to pick and choose the ones that are actually worth your time.  

Then invest time into those.  

You need to find other people who are learning about and talking about the use of technology in the modern workplace, and you need to engage with them in meaningful discussion.  

You need to hear a Senior talk about what they learned in their internship last summer.  
You need to hear from classmates that Professor Jones is hot-garbage, and you should take Professor Smith's class instead.  

Putting practical work experiences on your resume needs to be a top-priority for you.  

> im thinking of the potential jobs that can be available after finishing my studies  

Don't set your mind on a specific job or career to specialize in.  

The hardest job to get will be your first job, and you need to be open to taking whatever you can find and making the most of it so you can springboard off of it towards something you like better.  

> What careers are the focus on at the moment?  

Don't try to focus your education on a specific career.  

Build a broad, stable foundation of technical knowledge that covers as many topics as you can fit into your brain so you are ready to follow any attractive path forward that suddenly appears before you.  

> And what courses should I take to prepare me for said careers?  

Fill all of your elective slots with more technical coursework, and less stupid fluff ""GPA boosting"" nonsense.  

Take some kind of an intro to programming that features Python.  
Some kind of a data networking class.  
Some kind of an Operating Systems class, hopefully featuring Linux.  
Something that exposes you to databases.  
Something that exposes you to business risk analysis as it applies to cybersecurity.  
Statistics is important, don't miss that.  
Do take a class that exposes you to the Cloud.  


Bust your ass to maintain a 3.0+ overall GPA, so you are eligible for as many Career Development Programs as possible.

1okjzze,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"What is the best way to continue my education in IT? So recently I've been able to start making decent money at this job I have working at a restaurant. I've went through a career center and got about 10 certs already with the biggest ones being a handful of Linux certs through Cisco, my ITF+ and a couple Networking certs through Testout.   
  
Now that I'm getting paid again I was going back through classes and realized Testout doesn't exist anymore Comptia bought them out and just got rid of them from what I can see. Cisco is still there but I wasn't a big fan of learning through cisco even though half of my certs came from them (Though it might have just been cause my professor did a shit job at explaining to us what we were to do with Cisco mostly running through the same static few simulations and answering a few questions.) and I really didn't like Comptia for a similar reason to Cisco just regurgitating information that doesn't really mean much to me back at a piece of paper (Or screen in this case I guess.) and that just didn't really ever work for me. I liked Testout because it actually had you run through simulations of what you're supposed to be doing whether it was networking, setting up servers etc and it helped as I was not only getting told what was supposed to happen I was then actually doing said thing to learn how to actually do it myself.

However now that Testout is gone I'm concerned that half of my certs are now not worth anything and that my only options are Cisco and Comptia which I'm already not happy about as I missed the second part of my A+ test because of a literal tornado, they took my cash and never gave me a refund and now I have to retake both parts and looking at the website it costs roughly a month of my paycheck to get just their study resources and the ability to take the test + retake if I failed the first go round.  So is there any good advice on how I should keep going forward?

1ok8f57,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"Am I being ridiculous by saying I hate IT. Hello everyone!

I feel conflicted about IT as a whole. I've been working help desk for 4 years at various MSPs, but it all boils down to the same stuff. Help the user with password reset, SSO, installing company apps, requesting permissions through Active Directory, and checking for tickets in ServiceNow.

Honestly, I'm so sick of it, and I'm losing all passion I have for the field because it seems I can only get the same type of help desk roles that are uninteresting and pay criminally low. (Who the fuck can live off of $18 an hour in 2025?!) A part of me feels like I'm throwing in the towel too early since I've only done help desk and nothing else.

I don't know how to get that to the next point. Do I need to get certs? Projects? Do I need to get a degree? Because I've been told by hiring managers that it's ""nice"" to have, but experience matters more.

nm8xki6,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"nan Bro, I get what you're going thru. I was at Help Desk for 2 years before moving on and it was the easiest job I ever had. (I think you have the wrong perspective) I started out at $25/hr and doing Password resets and Active Directory was the easiest part of IT. Sure it gets old and unfulfilling but man was it EASY, to me. 

The way I think (my perspective) is they're paying me $25/hr to babysit users who didn't know their left hand from their right hand, I had a user who would call everyday for a password reset because she kept forgetting her new password that she picked. lol

You need to skill up and move up if you find it so boring. I did eventually move up to Tier 2 Help Desk and then Sysadmin and then to Database ( I studied at work when I had free time waiting for tickets and between tickets).

Don't look at a job as boring, look at it as you're getting paid to do the easiest work. Some people have to do hard labor for $18/hr or less. You press a couple of buttons to change a password. I would be happy to do that.

nm8qp5p,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"nan yes, you hate help desk roles, IT includes way more than just the work you have done so far. There is so much more to hate, but you can't really say that you hate all of it yet, as you haven't tried most of it yet. Get some certs, what are you interested in? Get certs in that.

1ok79n3,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"Niche IT career may be coming to an end. What IT fields/skills/certs would you recommend? Hi all, 

I have been certified for and working in a niche IT field for about 8 years now. My job is databsse administration for a non-standard database that is highly popular for my industry. Job openings and recruitment efforts for this job seem to have dropped off in the past few years. I am sure this is partly due to the overall job market, but some major vendors within the field are also making moves to PaaS - which replaces the need for their customers to hire for my role and multiple other roles for running and maintaining the systems. 

My current company is heavily considering moving to the vendor-managed services, so I am looking for other opportunities. I'm not finding many other openings in the same field, and recruiters have not reached out to me looking to fill a position in a long while, which I used to see monthly and even weekly at times. 

It looks like I may need to switch specialties, so I am looking for advice on what skills/certs I should work on in the meantime. I also need help determining IT fields that my experience is directly relevant for. I definitely should have worked on learning more skills/languages in this time, but I have been a bit lazy. Time to put my nose to the grindstone. 

SQL administration might be the obvious choice, so any input on the state of that field would be greatly appreciated!

I'll provide some of my skills/experience below. Thanks in advance! 

- UNIX/Linux ""poweruser"" experience: shell scripting, light administration, troubleshooting
- Universal database administration skills: backup administration, server maintenance, performance monitoring/tuning, high-availability/disaster recovery planning and testing, architecture/capacity planning, vulnerability mitigation
- Trained (not certified) in SQL Administration with minimal hands-on experience
- Trained (not certified) in AWS with minimal hands-on experience
- Six Sigma Yellow Belt: basic process improvement practices

nm8287t,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"nan 1) Do well in high school, maintain your GPA, volunteer, apply to scholarships. Do Dual Enrollment or/and AP courses. See what universities will accept those credits, which will lessen the load of graduation (or help you graduate earlier, but I'd prioritize graduating on time with internships).

2) See what universities will offer you a hefty scholarship. If none, second best bet is to do Community College and RESEARCH what credits will transfer to the university you want to transfer.

2.5) Personally, I would prioritize cost (whatever university will give you the most scholarships), then opportunities (does the University have a course or prep you for internships? Do they have industry connections? Are their career fairs big? Do they have established alumni/ties to companies? Do the professors have connections?). However, if cost isn't necessarily the biggest worry, then prioritize opportunity.

3) Do well on the SAT/ACT. Can help you get bigger scholarships.

4) Take whichever pathway that sounds the most interesting to you. You can always pivot in University/College if you don't like one or the other. You're in high school so explore.

5) If you really enjoy high-level math (calc and such), go with Computer Science. If you hate math, go with IT. Generally speaking, Computer Science has faster earning potential and can pivot into IT easier. IT's level of difficulty of advancement will be slower. You'll really only become valuable as you get more experience, which requires opportunity and skillsets that are presently in demand (Cloud > Virtual Machine > Servers or AI > Machine Learning > Big Data > are some examples of very hot skills that got overtaken/killed by the next iteration of hype).

6) Find a job where you can leverage customer service. I'd always rank being a server, retail, or services (such as library/hospitality) higher than fast food or cook. You earn money in high school/college while also growing your soft skills. This will be leverage in the future and will make it easier when applying to internships or entry-level positions. Furthermore, it shows you can do the bare minimum of work: showing up, doing your job, being on time, etc while giving you potential references.

7) Always be open to opportunities, especially if you have high availability. Growing your network of people is invaluable. With remote work killing local competition and AI slop mixed into the job market, companies are now more than ever ALL about who you know, rather than what you know. Being referred or being personable/known by a recruiter will get you a job faster than spamming applications because everyone else is spamming. As such, being in someone's network will put you at a higher rank, rather than what you know. Having both will make you unstoppable.

8) Hone specific niches and be an expert. Don't be a generalist. If you like programming, stick to a few languages. For IT, you may need to be a generalist initially with hardware, networking, OS, etc. However, after 2-4 years of experience, you'll need to specialize in specific technologies: Networking, Database, Cloud, IT Management, Project management etc. If you don't specialize, you'll be stuck in IT support with no other way out, unless that's your passion.

9) CS - Do projects. Find open source stuff. Avoid having AI code for you. Learn to struggle not knowing and racking your brain.

IT - Get CompTIA certs. Then get specialized, industry certs (Microsoft, AWS, CISCO, etc) into niches as mentioned in point 8.

nm0vgq1,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"nan Heres my roadmap suggestions. Assuming you mean operations/engineer/administration

Certs for your understanding of the cloud platforms. Especially if you can make them practical. Build labs and such.

Once you get a decent understanding of the cloud platforms. Explore the hell out of them via scripting languages.

Why? Because the careers in this field are all about automation. Look at any job for AWS or Azure. And you will see a pattern.

It will mention the cloud platform for about 20% of it. And the rest will be all scripting, coding automation, api, pipelines, and modern compute services like containers/Kubernetes.

Pick your cloud platform. Lab it with code. Upload code to github. Link GitHub to Resume.

I only know Azure so if thats the route:  
\- Azure cert(Az-104 + Sc-300 are all you really need IMO)  
\- Learn PowerShell and explore Azure and EntraID through it.  
\- Learn Terraform or Bicep for deploying IaC  
\- Make sure to pick up APIs on the way (you can do so with powershell)  
\- Learn Pipelines to sitch all of these together into a complete deployment  
\- (Put all of this into github as mentioned to showcase your work to potential employers)  
\- Learn containers and K8s. Explore AKS  
\- (Put the yaml work in github again)

If you are going the Azure Route:  
\- Go to John Savill, he's the goat of teaching Azure: [John Savill's Technical Training - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@NTFAQGuy)  
\- And are curious about how Azure and automations work. I am building this channel: [Adeel Automates - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AdeelAutomates)

But if I am perfectly honest. Start applying NOW. You have the education. Break into the industry while the education is fresh. Or have a good excuse why you don't have a job in the industry after getting a bachlors and a masters. People will 1/4 of what you have are trying to break in. Take anything at this point as it will pave the way to cloud roles (they are usually not entry level even the support ones).

nlv7dun,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"nan >Is this a realistic pivot with my background?

Realistic?  No.  You are hyperfocusing too much on networking.  I came up as a network engineer and architect.  Took me years of experience and a CCNA/CCNP to get into a network engineering role.  You have to know more than just networking.  You should know windows server and linux as well.  You don't have to be some AD master, but you have to know how these things communicate and work.  

Getting your CCNA may qualify you on paper for junior level networking or NOC roles, but the chances of you landing such a job with no networking experience and just a CCNA is going to be very difficult.

>Should I first study the CompTIA trifecta first and then become a Network Technician/ NOC Technician and then bother with CCNA?

The CCNA is a good cert to get for networking roles.  The problem is that to qualify for those roles, you may have to spend some time in the entry level trenches learning the basics.  So you may want to consider the A+ and Sec+ as well.

>Will employers see ""software person switching to networking"" as a red flag, or does CCNA + CS degree make it credible?

1ohye7u,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"How to Nail an IT Resume in Australia (From Someone Who’s Read Hundreds) Hey folks...I thought I’d share some perspective as someone who’s done a lot of hiring in the Australian IT sector.

I’ve been a Head of Delivery and now a GM/CTO at a mid-sized tech company, and I’ve read *hundreds* of resumes across roles from interns to senior engineers. Most of them blur together — same layout, same skills, same buzzwords.

Here’s what actually gets attention from hiring managers here in Australia.

# 1. Your Resume Isn’t a Biography (It’s a Marketing Document)

Learn this quickly. It will change your approach to job hunting.

Most people treat their resume like a record of everything they’ve done.

But hiring managers already assume you’ve done things (that’s why you’re applying).

Your resume’s real job is to make someone *want* to talk to you.

If your bullet points could appear on someone else’s resume, they’re too generic.

# 2. Show Impact, Not Activity

Replace *what you did* with *what changed because you did it.*

Ask yourself: *So what?*

Instead of:

* Implemented CI/CD pipeline

Try:

* Cut deployment time from 2 hours to 10 minutes by implementing CI/CD, enabling faster releases and fewer rollbacks.

Instead of

* Mentored 3 interns

Try:

* Mentored 3 interns, one of whom was hired full-time and now maintains production code.

Impact is what separates a doer from a difference-maker.

**3. Use the X-Y-Z Formula**

Google recruiters teach this, and it works:

***Accomplished \[X\], as measured by \[Y\], by doing \[Z\].***

Example:

>Improved delivery efficiency by 10% by automating Jira sprint reporting.

Even if you don’t have perfect metrics, estimate them. It shows you think in outcomes.

# 4. Keep Volunteering & Soft Skills For the Interview

That stuff absolutely matters - but your resume space is valuable.

Focus on why you’re the right hire *now*.

You can share the human side and broader experiences once you’re in the room.

**5. AI Can Help (If You Give It Good Inputs)**

ChatGPT or Claude can make your resume sound sharper, but they can’t invent impact.

Try prompts like:

* “Rewrite my resume for a \[role\] using measurable, impactful language.”
* “Optimize this for ATS.”
* “Give me brutally honest feedback.”

AI can polish your words, not your substance.

# Final Thought

A good resume tells me what happened *because you were there*, not just that you were there.

If you met someone at a party, would you find them more interesting if they told you about their experiences, lessons learned and their impact on others in their life, or if they rattled off a bunch things they know and skills they have?

That’s how hiring works too.

These are just some thoughts I had recently when helping someone.

Happy to be challenged on this — I’d love to hear what others think, especially from recruiters or hiring managers in Australia.

1o6qxcf,Tech,netsec,"MCP Snitch - The MCP Security Tool You Probably Need With the recent GitHub MCP vulnerability demonstrating how prompt injection can leverage overprivileged tokens to exfiltrate private repository data, I wanted to share our approach to MCP security through proxying.

**The Core Problem:** MCP tools often run with full access tokens (GitHub PATs with repo-wide access, AWS creds with AdminAccess, etc.) and no runtime boundaries. It's essentially pre-sandbox JavaScript with filesystem access. A single malicious prompt or compromised server can access everything.

**Why Current Auth is Broken:**

* Want to read one GitHub issue? Your token needs full repo access to ALL repositories
* OAuth 2.1 RAR could fix this but has zero adoption
* API providers have no economic incentive to implement granular, temporal scoping

**MCP Snitch:** An open source security proxy that implements the mediation layer MCP lacks:

* Whitelist-based access control (default deny, explicitly allow operations)
* Runtime permission requests with UI visibility
* API key detection and blocking
* Comprehensive logging of all operations

**What It Doesn't Solve:**

* Supply chain attacks (compromised npm/pip packages)
* Persistence mechanisms (SSH keys, cron jobs)
* Out-of-band operations (direct network calls from MCP servers)

The browser security model took 25 years to evolve from ""JavaScript can delete your file"" to today's sandboxed processes with granular permissions. MCP needs the same evolution but the risks are immediate. Until IDEs implement proper sandboxing and MCP gets protocol-level security primitives, proxy-based security is the practical defense.

1olnoje,Tech,cybersecurity,"Wiz Alternative Hi security communauty,

  
I guess this have been aldready discusssed but here my context.  
We are in the process of renewing our Wiz annual subscription and each time it's a pain.  
While we are relatively happy with Wiz (relatively ; their gui is messy; their scanners are slows ; their code module is a joke) the main problem is their pricing model by workload scan.   
The main issue for issues is are really elastic and have really a lot of ephemeral workloads.  
We can go from 500 instances/containers to 4000 on the same day (we use AWS).

We spin a lot of the time the exact same instance from a template in ASG.  
We don't want to scan everything (and we don't want to pay for it)/

With Wiz it's not possible to really exclude a workload from scanning with tagging (this is a request we asked for years but it still not there). And frankly we begin to be bored having the same discussion every year....

So we are now open to alternatives but which?

Our main need is to have a cloud security posture tool : so a CSPM.

\- aikiddo security? (at least they are reactive but they seems more focus on development lifecyle)

\- upwind ?

\- other ?

Obviously we want something cheaper with a way more flexible company.

CPTS is much more in depth, but it is not fair to compare them, one took maybe 10 days, the other like 4 months. I've not used tryhackme since then. I prefer hackthebox because the hand holding I experienced in tryhackme annoyed me quite a lot. Though, some modules on htb can feel a bit too fluffy, I don't know, let say wordy, or like if they were passed through an LLM, but otherwise the content, as far as I can tell, is pretty good. 

I had the same questions and I've come to the conclusion that I'm not sure we are supposed to retain everything. In my experience retention comes with practice and also with the fact that, in htb, we have to struggle a bit, even if often the solution can be quite simple. In general it is also important to take notes we can refer to. I find each module to be really approachable, but the difficulty can arise when we have to bring it all together, when the possibilities are open. 

So for me, it is about knowing where to find the info, knowing that a technique exists and that you have have done it already, even if you don't remember all the commands from the top of your head. So I wouldn't be too much be concerned about memorizing, but I would focus on building a methodology, which is not easy when starting, but you can see it as a process to refine. 

I don't know if hackthebox is better structured, I mean the cpts path covers consequent topics like active directory and web which are specializations on their own, but it also has specific modules that are, let say, transversal or one offs. It kinda builds gradually in difficulty, but because it is meant to bring people up-to-speed, it has to be wide and sometimes it can feel a bit like an info dump. For instance, the windows privesc module covers a lot of techniques and it can feel like we jump from one to another. There isn't much to do about that,  it is very generous of them to give the most they could in a digestible enough format. 

I wished they would have structured the course following something similar to the Mitre Attack framework, but given the amount of info and the need to make bite-sized modules, I guess it was not possible. If I had to do it again I would, from the start, link the modules an actionable framework because it is painful to do it afterwards. Also I would advise to read the nearly last module about reporting as it is useful to practice it through all the labs and skills assessment in the learning path.",['active directory'],i did tryhackme junior pentester and after i did the cpts course from hackthebox cpts is much more in depth but it is not fair to compare them one took maybe days the other like months ive not used tryhackme since then i prefer hackthebox because the hand holding i experienced in tryhackme annoyed me quite a lot though some modules on htb can feel a bit too fluffy i dont know let say wordy or like if they were passed through an llm but otherwise the content as far as i can tell is pretty good i had the same questions and ive come to the conclusion that im not sure we are supposed to retain everything in my experience retention comes with practice and also with the fact that in htb we have to struggle a bit even if often the solution can be quite simple in general it is also important to take notes we can refer to i find each module to be really approachable but the difficulty can arise when we have to bring it all together when the possibilities are open so for me it is about knowing where to find the info knowing that a technique exists and that you have have done it already even if you dont remember all the commands from the top of your head so i wouldnt be too much be concerned about memorizing but i would focus on building a methodology which is not easy when starting but you can see it as a process to refine i dont know if hackthebox is better structured i mean the cpts path covers consequent topics like active directory and web which are specializations on their own but it also has specific modules that are let say transversal or one offs it kinda builds gradually in difficulty but because it is meant to bring people uptospeed it has to be wide and sometimes it can feel a bit like an info dump for instance the windows privesc module covers a lot of techniques and it can feel like we jump from one to another there isnt much to do about that it is very generous of them to give the most they could in a digestible enough format i wished they would have structured the course following something similar to the mitre attack framework but given the amount of info and the need to make bitesized modules i guess it was not possible if i had to do it again i would from the start link the modules an actionable framework because it is painful to do it afterwards also i would advise to read the nearly last module about reporting as it is useful to practice it through all the labs and skills assessment in the learning path,positive

1okopit,Tech,cybersecurity,"Leaving cybersecurity without even properly staring. Feeling lost and defeated Hello guys !



I am throwing in the towel and leaving cybersecurity and the worst part I dont even think my career in cybersecurity has started. I had so much curiosity and so much passion to learn but somewhere down the line the love has just vanished.



Here is my story.



I am 28M from India that works as a Sysadmin/security admin for a startup. I have a masters degree in cybersecurity (OMSCY GaTech), CCNA, MCSA (Windows Server), CEH, eJPT and BTL1.



I have been following the advice and roadmaps since I was in University to get into cybersecurity. The general consensus was that to break into cyber one should have basic IT knowledge, networking, servers, operating systems, maybe some scripting, then security basics, and then a specialization into defensive/offensive. And the golden ""Cybersecurity is not an entry level job so you must have some experience before you can break into a cyber role.""



I did all of that. I got a Masters degree, got certs to have hands on skills that the degree didnt teach, practiced on my home lab, did THM daily (top 0.5%), wrote research papers, worked for 3 years as a Sysadmin to get the experience, applied to jobs for 30 minutes a day everyday for months, tailored resumes based on JDs, pivoted to blue team seeing that red team role was too ambitious, got BTL1, practiced on BTLO everyday till I was ranked 19th in the country, networked on linkedin, contacted people I knew for referrals and yet I am here, ranting on reddit with no security role in sight.



I have officially given up. I cant continue like this. I am not seeing any light at the end of my tunnel right now. I am quitting my role in the startup and going to a Fortune 500. My current organization gives me great pay but I feel like I have stagnated and have become complacent. I dont see any improvement in me and the skills I had learnt for certs are rusting away. So I decided to make a switch to a Fortune 500 and see what being a small cog in a large machine feels like. This decision wasnt purely rational, I was extremely frustrated because I was feeling stuck. I am currently learning azure administration for the new role and hopefully I can hit the ground running at the new job.



All I have now is the hope that maybe moving to a new job and a new physical location will help me somehow refind my love for security. Its just blind optimism. I have always been a learner and a tinkerer. I had genuine love for taking things apart (literally and metaphorically) and figuring out how they worked but now that feeling has gone.



I hope this is temporary and in a year I come here to post again about how I landed a role as a security consultant. Its a dream that I still want to believe in. But for now, its a good bye from me. From today, no THM, no BTLO, no Linkedin, no Krebs on security, no new certs and no more applying to cybersecurity roles. For a year I am just going to focus on this new job and not think about 'what could have been'. Maybe I wasnt cut out for cybersecurity.



To everyone who is still trying hard everyday, I wish you well. I hope it works out for you in the way you intend !

1okmub8,Tech,cybersecurity,"Network Security Labs Designed By Grok (Self Modification) **ATTENTION: Looking for feedback!**  


With experiences (around 7+ years) in network security as SE and the trending of ""Vibe Coding"", I'm bored and wanted to build something for fun. Thus, I asked grok and chatGPT to help me design labs to motivate everyone, who would like to study and practice network security concepts. After many clarification, here are the concept I have built.    
  
Initially, the labs are organized into 10 progressive levels, each introducing new security concepts and hands-on scenarios:

# Level Overview

* **Level 1: Basic Traffic** Explore baseline network traffic, load web pages, observe HTTP/DNS, sniff packets, and perform port scans.
* **Level 2: Firewall** Enable/disable firewalls, create inbound/outbound rules, block client/attacker traffic, and understand packet filtering.
* **Level 3: Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** Enable IDS, simulate and detect attacks (SQL injection, XSS, directory brute force), and review/tune alerts.
* **Level 4: Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** Enable IPS, actively block and prevent attacks in real time, and evaluate impact/false positives.
* **Level 5: TLS/SSL** Enable TLS, compare HTTPS vs. HTTP traffic, inspect certificates/SNI, and understand encrypted communication.
* **Level 6: VPN** Configure VPN tunnels, encrypt traffic between client and server, observe encrypted vs. unencrypted packets, and understand secure remote access.
* **Level 7: WAF (Web Application Firewall)** Deploy WAF rules, detect and block OWASP Top 10 attacks (SQL injection, XSS, command injection), analyze HTTP request filtering, and tune policies.
* **Level 8: SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** Aggregate logs from multiple sources (firewall, IDS, server), correlate events, create detection rules, and investigate security incidents with centralized visibility.
* **Level 9: Threat Intelligence & IOC Matching** Integrate threat intelligence feeds, match indicators of compromise (IPs, domains, file hashes), automate blocking, and respond to emerging threats.
* **Level 10: Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Simulation** Face a multi-stage APT campaign with reconnaissance, lateral movement, data exfiltration, and C2 communication. Apply all learned defenses (firewall, IDS/IPS, SIEM, threat intel) to detect and respond to sophisticated attacks.

Each level provides guided instructions, interactive simulations, and a quiz to reinforce learning. Progress is saved between sessions.

So far, I have created a dummy data to interact with each level + AI assistance (easy with APIs)

My question now: What is the next stage? What would you improve/add/modify the labs?

**Note: I built this project to reinforce my knowledge and stay sharp outside of my daily work.**

nmd18my,Tech,technology,"nan For anyone that says AI is the cause of these layoffs. I have a question for you. A significant portion of the job cut at Amazon was at the Amazon Games Studio (AGS), and the studio behind New World and a yet unannounced Lord of the Rings game.

If AI is driving these cuts, why cancel these projects entirely, why not cut the work force in half, and tell the developers to make up the difference with AI productivity. AI art / code means that game development is potentially one of the richest areas for AI to improve productivity.

I think this fact alone kinda dismantles the whole ""AI taking jobs"" perspective.

nmck18c,Tech,gadgets,"nan From the article: The team behind the original Sound Blaster audio card has turned to Kickstarter to fund their latest project. Sound Blaster Re:Imagine is a modular audio hub designed to simplify device management, function as a programmable stream deck, and so much more.

At the heart of the Re:Imagine is an octa-core Arm-based SoC paired with 8GB of LPDDR4 RAM and 16GB of eMMC flash storage. There's also a 6-TOPS neural processing unit and a studio-grade DAC and amp that delivers high-resolution playback up to 32-bit / 384 kHz with the ability to power headphones / large speakers up to 300Ω.

The platform operates as a standalone unit running Linux OS, or can be connected to a PC via USB. The team is initially offering the kit with a horizontal base that accommodates five modular slots (two for the display, the other three for components like buttons, knobs, or sliders) although a stretch goal with six total slots in a 2x3 pattern is also in the works.

All of the unit's buttons and switches are programmable, allowing users to perform functions like muting a call, launching a game, or starting a recording with a single action. More advanced users can leverage the included SDK to create their own apps and control devices in new ways thanks to root hardware access.

You don't need to be a programmer to extract value from Re:Imagine out of the box, the team notes. The unit will ship with several pre-loaded apps including a DOS emulator for on-device retro gaming, an AI DJ that can automatically generate music based on prompts, and one-tap visualizers. There are even new AI-powered versions of classics like Dr. Sbaitso and the Sound Blaster Parrot.

The Creative team has already smashed their modest funding goal with more than $87,000 pledged from 277 backers as of writing, and 57 days remaining. Early bird pricing starts at $329, which includes a horizontal base, a smart screen module, a dual slider module, a buttons module, and a knob module.

nksh2bq,Tech,gadgets,"nan From the article: Even though the value proposition was put in the backseat, Microsoft and Asus took a step in the right direction for PC handhelds with the new ROG Xbox Ally, especially with the work done to optimize Windows and create the Xbox Full Screen Experience (FSE). By turning off unnecessary background tasks and disabling much of the telemetry, the team was able to squeeze out more FPS without upping the power limits — all while sporting a polished, console-like UI. Turns out, the hardware is actually capable of even more than that, courtesy of Linux, of course.

In a not-so-scientific benchmark conducted by YouTuber Cyber Dopamine, the Rog Xbox Ally managed to perform better without Windows, the operating system it ships with out of the box. Cyber installed Bazzite, a popular Linux distro for handhelds built specifically to offer that console-esque, seamless experience. Visually, Bazzite looks identical to SteamOS because it uses Steam's Big Picture Mode as its main launcher. It also behaves similarly, but has its own custom menus and settings for customizing things like power profiles (which override Asus' built-in ones).

When testing Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Cyber noticed a shockingly significant jump in FPS, with Linux generating ~32% more FPS compared to Windows. This trend follows at lower wattages, albeit with less noticeable differences, and the delta actually plateaus in Hogwarts Legacy to the point that both Bazzite and the Xbox FSE offer the same FPS at 13W. That being said, those frame rates are much more consistent on Linux, according to Cyber, who shows that the FPS graph on Windows fluctuates regularly, while staying mostly flat on Bazzite.",['linux'],from the article even though the value proposition was put in the backseat microsoft and asus took a step in the right direction for pc handhelds with the new rog xbox ally especially with the work done to optimize windows and create the xbox full screen experience fse by turning off unnecessary background tasks and disabling much of the telemetry the team was able to squeeze out more fps without upping the power limits all while sporting a polished consolelike ui turns out the hardware is actually capable of even more than that courtesy of linux of course in a notsoscientific benchmark conducted by youtuber cyber dopamine the rog xbox ally managed to perform better without windows the operating system it ships with out of the box cyber installed bazzite a popular linux distro for handhelds built specifically to offer that consoleesque seamless experience visually bazzite looks identical to steamos because it uses steams big picture mode as its main launcher it also behaves similarly but has its own custom menus and settings for customizing things like power profiles which override asus builtin ones when testing kingdom come deliverance cyber noticed a shockingly significant jump in fps with linux generating more fps compared to windows this trend follows at lower wattages albeit with less noticeable differences and the delta actually plateaus in hogwarts legacy to the point that both bazzite and the xbox fse offer the same fps at w that being said those frame rates are much more consistent on linux according to cyber who shows that the fps graph on windows fluctuates regularly while staying mostly flat on bazzite,positive

What this does help with, though, is making a cross-platform codebase that you can then build native UI on top of, which is handy for a bunch of things.

nmklm1y,Tech,linux,"nan I feel like I've had some insight into this recently. There was news that Win 7 use is growing. That should result in sober consideration of why people prefer that over a lightweight linux distro. Instead, a bunch of linux fans were calling those people ""stupid"" for not seeing the enormous betterness of linux. (I think it was on this sub, I don't remember).

That's kind of hard to take when we've been essentially forced to use systemd which takes 24% longer to boot, and leaves you with 6% less memory. We're always told to ""get over it, everyone else has."" For someone with Win7 hardware, 24% longer boot could be a full minute longer to tell themselves ""it doesn't mater."" (If they object, they're ""stupid.""). 6% more memory could be precious to them.

Linux isn't everything we crack it up to be. The systemd chauvinism is still occurring. It's been possible for years to offer init-sytem choice at boot time. MX Linux has been doing it. Something changed upstream breaking that. It's been almost a complete non-topic. But, that reflects how virtually no other distros have been doing it. Someone like canonical has had the resources and influence to provide (standarize) that kind of choice. That would've spread to all the distros that are ubuntu respins. (Losing more choice like we are now wouldn't have gone over as silently as it is now.).

And then we wonder why people with old hardware don't find value in linux (as we throw away perfect good time & memory just because ""everyone else is doing it."").  Not just wonder why, but brag about linux's morality. I think that double-standard drives people away.

Rust is supported on all officially supported Debian platforms. This isn't a breaking change for them. Even an i386 port should be entirely fine with this (Rust supports 32-bit Linux even though Debian dropped it in 13/Trixie).

1oln57j,Tech,linux,"Orbitiny Desktop 1.0 Pilot 7X Released Written in Qt and C++, **Orbitiny Desktop** is a new, **portable** and innovative and traditional desktop environment for Linux. **Innovative** because it has features **not seen in any other desktop environment before** while **keeping traditional aspects of computing alive** (desktop icons, menus etc). It supports desktop gestures (swiping on an empty area on the desktop to perform an action), it's got its own file manager, a **real** device manager that lets you disable and enable devices **without** blacklisting modules or reboots, a panel with **full** Drag&Drop support (drag any file from any file manager onto the panel to add it or drag any item without entering some sort of ""Edit"" mode) and a lot more.

# 1.0 Pilot 7X - Release Notes:

* **Qutiny File Manager**: New: Implemented a Device Properties dialog with pie chart usage graph, disk labeling, file system check, disk management and partition formatting support
* **Qutiny File Manager**: BugFix: Fixed a crash when searching for content inside files
* **Qutiny File Manager**: BugFix: Fixed ""Generate File Listing"" freezing and sometimes not launching issue
* **Qutiny File Manager**: BugFix: Fixed an intermittent spontaneous crash when file navigating
* **Qutiny File Manager**: BugFix: Fixed a crash in Trash view when clicking on an item after ""Sort by Date Deleted (Newest First)"" is selected
* **Orbitiny Panel**: Fixed an intermittent (but permanent after it happens) panel disappearing bug when the panel is docked (once it is docked)
* **File Properties Dialog**: BugFix: Fixed an intermittent File Properties freezing bug sometimes when File Properties is brought up on the screen
* **System Information**: Added the operating name to the ""System Information"" caption. So now it also tells you the name of the distribution being used, for example: Btw OS :)
* **System Information**: The ""Filter"" field now also filters the data value rather than the data field only. Example: If there is a field called ""Graphics Card"" (and there is) and if your graphics card vendor happens to be XYZ for instance and you enter either ""gra"" or ""xyz"" in the ""Filter"" field, the result will now appear. Previously, the value ""XYZ"" would not have appeared if you searched for ""xy"" and that's because the data value was not searched, only the field names were searched.
* **Panel Theme**: Improved the ""Coconut"" theme
* **Panel Theme**: Improved the ""Vanilla"" theme - the blue XP like background looks much nicer now (I am not done yet).
* **Panel**: Increased the default size of the panel when your first launch an Orbitiny binary download
* Changed the default theme to ""Modern-B"" - just for a change to see how it goes
* Various other improvements throughout the code

nmi53w2,Tech,linux,"nan Generally most of this is horseshit. Not all, but most.

Arch uses standard APIs and syscalls. May be different than Debian's, but it's not some wild west. 

The GDPR requirements are somewhat valid - on the merit that it's generally easier and more convenient to make Debian and Fedora compliant with strict ISO and GDPR requirements for corporations.

Package signing is shit. Both sign packages.

AUR is NOT trustworthy. No matter what Arch users say, it's not. Period. These are community-driven packages, that can be okay, but can be unmaintained, break dependencies, or contain malicious code. Yes, you can read PKGBUILD, but you will still need to read the whole source code to make sure.

And yes, COPR, RPMFusion, PPAs are ALSO not trustworthy. All of these are community effort that may or may not be okay, and all that I said about AUR is valid here.

Flatpaks and Snaps also, but here you eliminate the dependency problem, since they provide their own in a sandbox.

The actual reasoning behind this is - in Debian you don't use PPAs (contrary to what many people here believe, it's actually discouraged by Debian team), instead for never versions of packages you use debian backports. Which are maintained by Debian team, so they are actual, official packages.

All in all - it depends on your use case. Truly, all Linux distros are the same under the hood. The only difference is package versions between rolling and LTS and package manager.

Basically I decided to get something smaller than my previous HP MiniServer and Thin Clients, they just needed too much space and made too much noise. Living in a small flat with wife and daughter, cannot use an entire room as lab. My two cute cats were also very annoyed by the constant fan noise of my stuff, they originally triggered the whole idea :)



So the base PCB is an hybrid between a routerboard (w/ WiFi7, we're using the Qualcomm IPQ9574 SoC) and a carrierboard with 2 Slots for 260-pins SoDIMM NVIDIA-style computing modules. I'm using here two TuringPI ARM modules (RK3588 SoC and 32GB RAM), each gets both a mSATA and an NVMe M.2 2280 slot for SSD storage. As regards ethernet, we have LAN1 as 10GE+SFP, LAN2 as 2.5GE+SFP, LAN3 as 2.5GE. 

Some GPIOs are exposed so I can connect contacts and relays and that stuff. I've added a RS485 port because who knows, it could be useful in future.



To be ready for any mobile use case, I've added not just one but FOUR slots for 5G modems. A friend of mine is in the TV broadcasting industry and would like to use it for real-time TV streaming in 4K, instead of some super-expensive stuff they have now, so we can bundle all 5G modems in order to get a fat pipe with super-stable latency and jitter.



Anyway, currently it's in my lab connected to a 1GE FTTH (no faster option here in my town) and I am running a Proxmox cluster on it, on the cluster I have Pi-hole and unbound, a custom ""Zero Knowledge"" on-prem Cloud developed by a very nerdy friend of mine, some more things I'm just testing, and my next plan is to move here my mail server, too. Home Assistant could also be an option, but I have currently zero experience with it. Anyway I've added a lot of IoT stuff to the pcb, just in case :-) Zigbee & BLE but also Z-Wave and DECT, that's a very reliable technology (dedicated radio spectrum!) and quite successful here in Europe (I'm in Germany). I've also added UWB, but still have to write that part of the firmware (it's meant to connect to my smartphone with greater security compared to Bluetooth).

I think there is so much unexploited potential in low-consumption ARM embedded linux devices, and I think such solution could appeal a lot of non-IT people, too, as it's everything in a box, a ""turnkey"" silent and energy-efficient solution, and it has an LTE out-of-band management chip, so if something is broken, an IT guy can always ""dial-in"" and fix any issue.

So six months ago, I finally quit my 9to5 cybersecurity job and decided to go all-in and try to build a startup around this project. My wife thinks I'm crazy.   
  
One friend of mine had the great idea to use it for healthcare, he's been working in that area (as myself) and there are massive cybersecurity and ""data silos"" problems, that we have an idea how to solve. After seeing the first running prototype, he also quit his job. So basically now we're already two working full-time here, without any salary, on this cat-triggered idea :) :).

In order to be able to build the device, we need some higher quantities, a couple of units it's ok just for initial prototyping. (The prototypes costed to us approx 20,000 EURO each!!) The problem is, even if we would get orders for say 1K pieces, it's not going to be cheap anyway, since it's industrial-grade, we've chosen very high quality components (as we want to sell it to healthcare guys, it must be super-reliable). So the manufacturing price would be around 830 EUR (+VAT), and you have to add one or two Som modules (another 180 bucks each). MSRP price would be 1.385 EUR (+VAT). 



If someone is interested in backing our project, we're currently crowdfunding it on Kickstarter, the very first early backers can get it with 40% off, so basically you're buying at our manufacturing price. I understand it's anyway still too expensive for the vast majority of ""normal"" people, who are used to consumer-grade stuff, but maybe it could appeal IT guys who has some money available for new projects. Who knows. Or who wants anyway a very-high end WiFi7 router, for example we do the same things as the TP link Archer BE900, which is around 650 EUR + VAT here, so if you consider that, we're not really expensive (because we have tons of extra features). What we are missing is just that fancy display :-) But we have a dedicated ""Remote Display Port"" and we're going to add a fancy display too, that can be positioned some meters / feets away. So that's going to be more useful actually.

My current enclosure is 3D printed, of course in the (unlikely) case we'd get hundreds of orders, we'll manufacture a proper nicer enclosure, too.



If someone is interested in my cat-triggered appliance ;-) , it's called Guardian and is on Kickstarter.

If anyone has any ideas on how my device could be used, I would be very grateful for any new suggestions. Of course I have already some ideas about AI inference and a local LLM, I'm just waiting for a new M.2 module that will be shipped in December. This could make a good combination with Home Assistant probably. And I guess with my mail server, too.

The biggest reason is Linux users have been using POSIX compliant shells like bash and zsh for decades before Microsoft decided to make Powershell available, at roughly the same time they also made bash available on Windows.

If you're an older Linux user such as myself, Powershell literally wasn't an option. If you're a newer Linux user, every Linux tutorial that's been written for the last 40 years uses POSIX compliant shell commands.

On top of that, having to add Microsoft repositories to your distro is a hurdle that most users won't go out of their way to do.

I couldn't tell you if Powershell was better or worse than bash; I know bash has some warts, I'm not going to pretend it's a great language, but it's good enough for me. It's fine for use as a CLI, kind of bad for scripts but usable.

1okrd5q,Tech,linux,"Looking for Demarc PureSecure Linux version. Greetings,

Back in the day (2003-ish) I started using the Windows version 1.6 of Demarc PureSecure. It was a NIDS type of application that used Snort and MySQL to sniff and report alerts. 

I've been using this for years. 5,222 days to be exact. (14.30 years) And that's not accurate since I had to rebuild after years of use. 

One of the features that I really liked was the ability to see the alert data since Demarc kept Snort rules in the database.

It also had the feature to monitor hosts and servers to a certain extent. I also found a way to create plugins to be able to do many other things.

So I still use Demarc PureSecure to monitor my home network using Snort 2.9.20, Barnyard 2 and any plugins that I built. 

Now that I have an UnRaid server I'd like to add PureSecure to monitor certain stuff. I know there was a Linux version of PureSecure and thought I had downloaded it, but I can't find it. I was wondering if maybe someone had a copy lying about somewhere and said ""I'm not going to delete that. I might need it someday."" So that ""someday"" is here today. 

Anybody happen to have a Linux copy of Demar PureSecure? 

/thx

nlxzstv,Tech,linux,"nan > Does anybody use a linux phone in Germany and can share their experience? 

I have a Fairphone 5 with Ubuntu Touch (24.04.1) and calling + messages work without an issue (MEDIONmobile). The only phone related issue I've had was that emergency broadcasts did not work (I hope this gets fixed soon, but I can only test it in a year).

Apps are a mixed bag tho...
Native apps are rarely available, so for most things you need to rely on web apps (which can be integrated with the system very nicely) and Waydroid for Android apps.
I mostly try to avoid Waydroid, because it causes random video playback issues, so I've been only using it for my S-Bahn ticket in Berlin (because their app is the only way I can use the ticket).
However, even with Waydroid some apps don't work at all.
The most common offender is banking apps, but any apps that require any device integrity level will most likely not work.
I just use my card for banking, but if you rely on your banking app in any way, Ubuntu Touch will not work for you.

When it comes to your specific needs:
- Calls and text messages work.
- Telegram has a native app that works really well, but lacks a few features.
- Signal has a native app, but it is in a very early stage and I did not test it.
- Threema does not seem to have a native app.
- Internet browsing generally works well, but the current browser is terribly outdated and some websites don't load correctly. However, a more up-to-date browser is already out as a beta and will most likely be the default before Christmas.

Some additional issues to be warned of:
- GPS is slow, because it does not use Assisted GNSS.
- Sometimes something (e.g. auto rotate) breaks and requires a reboot to work again.
- On many devices (e.g. Fairphone 5) unlocking the bootloader is required, which means that the device will display a warning message before each boot, which cannot be disabled (from what I've heard this is a requirement from Google). This delays the boot by a few seconds.
- Notifications rarely work well (for me, only the E-mail app reliably delivers them) and notifications from websites don't work

So far, I am able to mostly use Ubuntu Touch in my day-to-day life, but I still bring my old Android phone with me, just in case I need it.

1oieh5s,Tech,linux,"Window Manager Selection and File Organization Q’s Hey team.

TLDR: New to Linux and want to make an educated WM choice before I spend endless hours customizing one of them, just to find out later it does not fit my criteria well. Couple other questions at the end, too.

Preferences:

- Wayland compositor (think I used that term right?). I understand Wayland performs better and is “the future”
- Tiling, but allows for floating toggle mode
- Either dynamic tiling out of the box or some way to set it up
- Performative/light. I’m trying to learn about Linux/computers and don’t want to be overwhelmed with too much going on in my computer. 
- Configurable/plug-in-able. I assume most of them are, but I’d like it to not be overwhelming to build from the base up.  

I am currently leaning towards Sway, but it seems like there are limitations on dynamic tiling. Would love some input if you think there is another one that suits my wants better.

Also, I would love to make a GitHub repo somewhere in ~/ or ~/.config/ so that I can keep all my customizations for when I distro hop or brick my computer from tinkering or whatever else. How does one go about doing this?

Also also, how can I set up Alt+Tab functionality like most DEs have with my WM? In my research for Sway, it seemed like it should be possible to have a Wofi menu that only shows open windows and bind to Alt+Tab, and then also having a Wofi menu for app search like windows. 

Also also also, if you have any hotbars, menus, customizations, or whatever else that you really like, I’d like to hear about them.

Thanks

nluwx7u,Tech,linux,"nan Tiling is heavily over rated.  A tiling WM is good for some tasks, but really the main benefit is that you can move your windows around and resize them without having to click and drag the tiny corners of them or ""lose"" windows behind one another. 

Here is some detail, which includes a ""challenge"" that can be performed on any OS, Linux/Windows/OS X. Mature environments like KDE and Gnome are a lot more capable then a lot of people imagine. 

http://xahlee.info/linux/why_tiling_window_manager_sucks.html

That being said there is nothing wrong with using a tiling WM if that is what you want. 

The popular Wayland versions right now seem to be Sway and Hyprland.  There is a very steep learning curve to them, especially for new Linux users. 

It would be useful if you go that direction to look into preset dotfile configurations. Like Omarchy or Hyprland paid support. Or whatever. I don't use Sway or Hyprland very much, but I understand that ""dotfiles sets"" (or whatever, not sure of the name) are a thing. 

Don't try to take too much on at once and don't worry about destroying your OS from fumbling around with it. Reinstalling from scratch occasionally isn't that big of a deal. 

It would be useful to setup a file server or separate server that you can use to backup your files. Or just use a external flash drive. Or both. The more copies you have of stuff the less likely you are going to lose them. 

'rsync' is a very useful tool for this. Play around with it and follow a couple different tutorials until you get the hang of it. Test it out and make sure it does what you think it does. 

> Also, I would love to make a GitHub repo somewhere in ~/ or ~/.config/ so that I can keep all my customizations for when I distro hop or brick my computer from tinkering or whatever else. How does one go about doing this?

There are a variety of tools for managing your dotfiles.  I use yadm, but there are other ones just as or more capable. Things like Chezmoi, stow and tons of others.

If you have a friend or somebody that already does this stuff use what they use so you can get help from them. 

They all do pretty much the same thing in slightly different ways. How you set them up with git and such things is specific for the tool. It should be well documented, if it isn't then move onto some other tool.

1oiby4z,Tech,linux,"Will developers ever truly care about Linux? Hey everyone,

I switched to Linux a little less than a year ago. At first, I ran a dual boot with Windows, mostly because I still needed to game (Warzone, Rust, Battlefield, etc.) and use Excel and Photoshop for work. The gaming part was fine, but the workflow just wasn’t sustainable. After playing a game, it didn’t make sense to reboot just to watch a Netflix show, since Netflix runs perfectly fine in any browser on any OS. So, like most people, I ended up staying on Windows all the time.

On October 14th, I decided to go all-in. No more dual boot. I accepted the loss of my games, but some tools were simply non-negotiable. My Excel files are critical, macros, formulas, and complex tables that break or corrupt when opened in LibreOffice. Rebuilding them from scratch just wasn’t an option. Same for Photoshop (I use an older licensed version that runs only on Windows).
Wine is working, but it ain't always it. I feel it's more a patch to a problem than a solution

So I built a Windows 11 VM inside my Linux system just for those tasks. It works well enough, but it’s frustrating to know I had to virtualize an entire OS just to keep doing basic things properly.

I know that for Excel and Photoshop, online versions now exist, but they require monthly subscriptions, and that’s out of the question for me. Plus, those two are just examples. I could name others I use regularly, and their so-called alternatives simply aren’t as good.

And that brings me to my question:
Do you honestly believe developers will ever start caring about Linux users in the near future?

Steam is doing a lot to push things forward, and I respect that, Proton, Steam Deck, all great steps. But beyond Valve, it feels like the rest of the industry doesn’t even think about us. I’d love to hear your opinions, am I being too pessimistic, or is Linux destined to remain a second-class citizen in the eyes of most software companies?

PS: I’m not looking for solutions, I’ve already found the compromises I’m willing to accept to follow my convictions. I’m just interested in hearing opinions about what the future looks like for Linux.

EDIT: I get the main point brought up in the comments, that developers themselves aren’t really the problem. Fair enough. The way I phrased it might’ve been confusing. What I actually meant was: the software providers, whether that’s the dev teams, the companies, or whoever decides which platforms to support. You could rephrase my question as:

Likewise, WPS Office is proprietary yet can run on Linux. Same with MATLAB, Mathematica, Maple, ChemDoodle, MarvinSketch, BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer and SAS. In fairness, most of the software packages I listed are intended for scientists, engineers and mathematicians, who may be more likely to use Linux. 

That being said, I do take your point that most proprietary software developers do ignore Linux users, but in fairness that's likely because they think Linux users will be a negligibly small possible market for them.

1oho91g,Tech,linux,"Casual gamer’s experience with Linux A couple of months ago, around the time Windows announced the end of Windows 10 support, I started looking into Linux. My main motivation was to get away from Microsoft and squeeze the most performance out of my system. The tipping point was when a friend told me about Linux Mint. After looking into it, I found it was one of the most recommended distros, so I decided to dual boot it and had a lot of fun setting it up.

Most of the issues I ran into I was able to solve through documentation, asking for help, and occasionally using AI when I got fed up — but I made sure never to run a command until I fully understood what it did. That approach helped me get a better grip on Linux and what was happening on my computer. I genuinely enjoyed learning how to use it.

The problems started once I got into gaming. I play about 3–5 different games every day since my friends all have different schedules and game preferences, so I keep a mix of single-player and co-op titles. While I do care about graphics, I prioritize performance — and I actually found that many games ran smoother on Linux. But when it came to getting HDR working or certain games to even launch, I hit roadblock after roadblock.

At first, I thought it was a skill issue, so I kept troubleshooting, both with and without help. Some games I got working, but others were a complete waste of time on Linux. About a month in, I updated Mint from 22.1 to 22.2 — and so many things broke that I rage-deleted Mint entirely. I started researching other distros, hoping it was just a Mint issue.

That’s when I discovered Ventoy, which made distro-hopping way easier. I tried out CachyOS and Bazzite before settling on Pop!_OS. I liked its look and found it the easiest to use with the fewest issues. But even then, I still found myself booting into Windows every day. No matter how much I tried to make Linux my main OS, something always came up, and after a while, it stopped being fun to troubleshoot.

The more I researched, the more discouraged I became — especially after learning about the “NVIDIA tax.” That really demotivated me. The final straw was when I had to make a friend with limited gaming time wait while I troubleshot another Linux issue just so we could play together. The easiest solution was always the same: boot into Windows.

TLDR; skill issue.",['linux'],casual gamers experience with linux a couple of months ago around the time windows announced the end of windows support i started looking into linux my main motivation was to get away from microsoft and squeeze the most performance out of my system the tipping point was when a friend told me about linux mint after looking into it i found it was one of the most recommended distros so i decided to dual boot it and had a lot of fun setting it up most of the issues i ran into i was able to solve through documentation asking for help and occasionally using ai when i got fed up but i made sure never to run a command until i fully understood what it did that approach helped me get a better grip on linux and what was happening on my computer i genuinely enjoyed learning how to use it the problems started once i got into gaming i play about different games every day since my friends all have different schedules and game preferences so i keep a mix of singleplayer and coop titles while i do care about graphics i prioritize performance and i actually found that many games ran smoother on linux but when it came to getting hdr working or certain games to even launch i hit roadblock after roadblock at first i thought it was a skill issue so i kept troubleshooting both with and without help some games i got working but others were a complete waste of time on linux about a month in i updated mint from to and so many things broke that i ragedeleted mint entirely i started researching other distros hoping it was just a mint issue thats when i discovered ventoy which made distrohopping way easier i tried out cachyos and bazzite before settling on popos i liked its look and found it the easiest to use with the fewest issues but even then i still found myself booting into windows every day no matter how much i tried to make linux my main os something always came up and after a while it stopped being fun to troubleshoot the more i researched the more discouraged i became especially after learning about the nvidia tax that really demotivated me the final straw was when i had to make a friend with limited gaming time wait while i troubleshot another linux issue just so we could play together the easiest solution was always the same boot into windows ive since deleted my linux partition and decided that for now debloating windows works better for someone like me hopefully one day ill reinstall linux and find it as seamless as windows but for now as a casual gamer with a job and friends to coordinate with its just too much of a tradeoff tldr skill issue,positive

nlq7s1t,Tech,linux,"nan I don't have a snapdragon system, so I can't speak of it.  I am typing this out on a Linux ARM system as we speak. 

Most of my experience is messing around with ARM SBCs and ARM router devices. So laptop devices... I have no clue about. But I am interested.

If you want to avoid all the issues and want to explore what ARM provides the dead nuts simple route is to go with a raspberry Pi. 

Raspberry Pi can run latest Linux versions from Debian, Fedora, etc... and thus you can get a idea of software compatibility before investing in a laptop.

It will be a LOT slower. So just keep that in mind. The Snapdragon laptops will be night and day faster. 

-----------------------------------


Linux software-wise is solid as far as open source software goes. On the server side it is the best because of how popular ARM is now on platforms like AWS. Linux desktop on arm is going to be largely indistinguishable from its x86_64 counterparts as far as open source goes. 

Like Gnome or KDE on ARM is solid experience.

-----------------------

The problem is the hardware side. 

Linux on x86_64 benefits heavily from standardization that Microsoft has imposed on the platform. Backwards compatibility is very important and Linux follows a ""What would windows do"" when it comes to hardware support. 

There is no such thing on the ARM platform. 

Typically what happens is that when a company creates a new ARM platform they will create hacked up kernels based on whatever is going to have long term support in Android. They don't really work with the Linux kernel community and get driver support in upstream first. 

Which means that while Linux support technically exists it is't pretty. You can run into ""teething"" issues that go on for years after a new device is released. As getting proper Linux support is a purely community effort with relatively low manufacturer involvement.  It can take years for mainline kernel to support something to the same level as you find on PC based hardware.


Another complication is that in ARM the job what is called a 'bootloader' is dramatically different then on x86.

In a PC you have POST, UEFI, then usually grub, then the Linux kernel. The POST and UEFI is handled by firmware on the device and it provides some standard interfaces for managing the CPU speeds, booting, memory, etc.

On ARM the ""bootloader"" is responsible for all that. You apply voltage to the cpu and it begins executing whatever it is hard coded in the main board traces to start executing. So the bootloader is responsible for doing things like configuring the pins on the CPU, initializing memory, activating storage devices, etc. 

This means that whatever you burn to your SPI or SD card of whatever the bootloader is stored in... is kinda your responsibility. Which means that for most ARM systems   it needs to have a image built for that specific device.  It can't be used on anything else. 

Uboot is the most common open source bootloader.

---------------------------------

This is changing with a push to create UEFI based bootloaders to create a much more PC like experience. 

A open source UEFI bootloader I've seen in a few places is EDK2. There is also a GNU UEFI effort, but it is only going to support a subset of UEFI. 

Provided your kernel has mainline support for the hardware, your distro is using a new enough kernel... then if your device has UEFI support you can probably download a generic ARM image from from them and use it, similar to how you do it for PC. Like boot and install the OS to NVME from a USB drive. 

So this is something to look for. 

----------------------------------------------


The last thing to keep in mind is distro support. Unless you are using one of the ""big mainstream"" distros... Fedora, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Debian, etc... They might not have ARM support. 

Armbian is very good and produces device-specific Uboot Debian/Ubuntu images for a variety of ARM based devices. They provide customization for Ubuntu and Debian to use vendor hacked up kernels, but also have rolling mainline vanilla kernels available for devices with support. 

There are two classifications of devices for ARM, ""bronze"" and ""platinum"".

I'm currently using Windows 10. I use this laptop for Android Development on an application/IDE called Android Studio. That's what I do for work so that's very important. 

I do use FL Studio from time to time, but if Zorin can't run it. I'll be fine. I do also use the laptop to watch shows, TVs and other media. So if it has a built in player or at least can run VLC that would be great.

I have a flash drive with more than enough storage(16gb) so I'm good there. I plan on Installing Zorin on the smaller SSD too.

I've NEVER used any Linux distro before. I have considered Mint, but from what I saw online. Zorin has easier installation guides and to me personally just looks nicer. Not that Mint would be hard to use. It looks insanely easy. Just a preference, but want to make the switch

There are so many great points in this discussion I won't reiterate but I will say a few things I maybe haven't seen yet.  

- If you're looking to learn to code you will fall in loooooove with running Linux
- Dependency hell is still a thing so get used to having to track stuff down
- Do yourself a big favor and learn Vim immediately
- Don't build anything if you can avoid it - use the package manager for that distro
- The learning curve can be a touch steep but stick to it and commit and you'll feel like a real power user in no time
- Understanding where things live will make your life a lot easier
- Hell, just having access to all the standard issue gnu tools will make you feel like hackerman 
- I personally don't like dual booting.  I say commit to it!
- Linux is wonderful for people who like to know how things work and who like to tinker.  If you want something that just works get a Mac.  If you want it EXACTLY how you feel it should be for you and your workflows Linux is the undisputed master
- Be prepared for multi-hour journeys to figure out some very small but useful thing.  It isn't hard to spend several hours tweaking on what you want in your powerline for tmux.
- Don't be afraid of it.  It takes some real deliberate effort to brick a linux box and most things can be just reinstalled (moving an install directory to a <install>.bak

1oh40dy,Tech,linux,"Stuck between my privacy or my hobbies I made the switch over to Linux about a year ago on my laptop to Mint. About 6 months ago, I switched distros on my laptop (arch btw), and then I went from windows to CachyOS on my main PC about a week ago. All I can say is that I love it. I play a bunch of video games, and even though I've had to give a bit of gaming up (Apex, R6, GTAO) the switch is still 100% worth it. Apart from one thing.

I'm a music producer who uses FL Studio. When doing my research for the switch, I found that FL actually wasn't too difficult to get running on Linux, so I decided to make the switch. But installing plugins and vsts is a whole new thing.  
I haven't been able to figure out how to get a few vsts working, let alone the 20ish I need to make my music. I just can't see linux working for my music production with how much of a headache it's been and I still haven't been able to get all the plugins I need working.

But I fucking hate microsoft. With a passion. I hate where they're taking windows, I hate the fact that they send all my data to who knows where, I hate that all of their software is closed source, everything about that company reeks.

But I literally don't know what to do now. Music is the one thing that keeps me sane. It's my main hobby in life, all of my goals revolve around it, I can't just give it up.

I've tried using VMs but they're so incredibly slow in my experience. Maybe I need to try something that's kernel level, but it does just seem like alot of work and inconvenience for something that I'm not even sure would work, plus I only have 1 GPU.

The idea of dual booting has floated around in my head, but wouldn't that just give microsoft all of my files and data anyway? What is even the point of being privacy focused on Linux if Microsoft read all of that data? Plus I don't want to have to reboot my PC when I go from general use to production and vice versa. I am quite an impulsive person and I switch between tasks often, restarting everytime I do that just seems annoying.

Maybe I've misunderstood something, maybe there's more to it, maybe the kernel level virtual machine would work well with my 1 GPU, maybe dual booting is worth it, I'm not sure.

nllpy6l,Tech,linux,"nan OK let's go by parts

If you want to do music production on Linux you can't use FL Studio as your main DAW because it only runs on Wine and makes connecting it with Windows plug-ins a nightmare (not impossible...). Fortunately enough there are amazing native Linux DAWs available that put FL Studio in a shoe, like Reaper and Bitwig Studio and then you can use FL as a plug-in to the main native linux DAW.

To use Windows vst plug-ins on Linux most people use an application called [Yabridge](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge) , this application makes it dead simple to run the plug-ins on Wine and then connecting them to your preferred NATIVE Linux DAW. You can see the list of supported DAWs in their page which are also the best DAWs available for Linux. Yabridge runs any plug-in with the exception of the ones with online anti-piracy authorization/verification, for those, what people do is download the cracked version and it just works (think NI).

If you absolutely can't live without FL Studio then the best thing to do is to dual-boot then run ""AME Wizard Privacy+"" this will strip windows from all the spyware and other annoying parts leaving you with a minimal windows very close to a linux distro (You will even have to install apps from the command line no Windows Store).

I make basically my entire tracks just in vcv, and do a little bit of stuff in Audacity (while Audacity can't do everything and some things are maybe clunky to do, I've been using it for like 20 years and it is easier for me to figure how to do something in Audacity than it has been to learn a DAW: for example with a guitar track, I'll use an app on my phone that gets bpm from tapping and I'll tap out the rhythm of the guitar to get the bpm for hydrogen or VCV, and then just line the tracks up by ear and visually). But to be fair I was never a DAW person, I've always just used Audacity and capturing performances. VCV rack takes some time to learn but it is so much fun and you can make anything with it, even just sticking to what is free.

So dual boot for now (if you encrypt your linux system, MS won't be able to access it. And keep a shared partition for files you need on both). And little by little move away from FL Studio.

nll59lo,Tech,linux,"nan That is something I have wished for and thought about myself a couple times. My install is 14 years old, I've long lost track of every tiny change I've made to random config files. It just works, and clearly I have every possible edge case handled because it's not broken in years (that I didn't deserve).

One of the main things I dislike about Nix is that it feels like _too much_, I don't want templated configs coming out of a million settings you can set to configure everything that I have to look up. I just want the packages. No default configs other than the upstream defaults, no autostarting my database wide open to the network just because it happens to be installed. I want package to put files on the disk, and that's really what Arch is all about. But I would love to be able to just declare all those things in a config file, with my own templates so I can build it around my needs, and it would make it a lot easier to keep my laptop in sync with all my dev environments and stuff.

I went as far as looking into composefs and how rpm-ostree does things. Obviously with Arch you run into the problem of stuff being naked in `/usr`, so instead of one big `/nix` store you don't worry about, you'll have to do it more like ostree where it materializes a view of a normal Linux system based off the actual paths of the files. That way it's also easy to make as many chroot environments as needed to roll back to specific versions of things for specific programs without breaking the whole system.

The value isn’t in having AI; it’s in how you wire it into your workflows, your data, and your client experience. These companies are essentially declaring that an AI-powered workflow is no longer a premium ""add-on"" but the new baseline for a core platform. They all know that in the coming months, a legal platform without this integrated AI will be considered incomplete.

2. It's a Land Grab for User Adoption - a defensive move against the Harvey’s and Legora’s and all the other newcomers. The battle has moved from models to context. Everyone now has access to good models. The next frontier is context: who can make those models reason with trusted firm knowledge and deliver answers lawyers can actually use. This is an aggressive move to build a ""moat"" on user habits. By including AI at no extra cost, they eliminate all friction for a firm's lawyers to start using it. Once a lawyer is used to the ""Litera way"" or the ""Relativity way"" of reviewing documents, the cost of switching to a competitor (which would require retraining) becomes higher. They are sacrificing short-term, per-use AI revenue for long-term, sticky platform subscriptions, leveraging their relative advantage (“We already have AI,” so no need to bring in new players).

3. The Classic ""Freemium” Upsell. 'Free’ AI isn’t generosity - it’s strategy. Vendors are removing price friction to drive usage and lock-in. This isn't really ""free""; it's a strategic shift to ""freemium"" at an enterprise scale. Everlaw's announcement is the most transparent example: individual AI actions are now included, but batch actions (where the real power in eDiscovery lies) still consume credits. This is a brilliant adoption strategy. They're removing the barrier to entry for everyday, small-scale use. They let lawyers get comfortable and see the value in summarizing a single document or drafting a quick email. Once that habit is built, the upsell to ""doing this for 10,000 documents"" becomes a much easier conversation.

In short, it's the ""platform-ization"" of AI in legal. The battle has shifted from ""who has AI?"" to ""whose AI is most deeply embedded in the work you already do?”

I've tried Smokeball's time tracking and billing, as it's included with my New York State Bar Membership. It's very a nice solution (though it lacked an important feature I needed for my solo practice).

Personally, I developed a time tracking and billing solution with FileMaker Pro. It has allowed me to add the features I need very quickly and easily, but it also would be a time and resource investment for your firm. I recreated my solution, to an extent, in Lotus Approach as an academic exercise. Time tracking and billing is actually pretty straightforward and relatively easy to automate.

Given that TimeSlips is very customizable, and is only available by subscription, have you reached out to Sage to assist you with customizing the interface to make it easier for you to use and manage?

1opntea,Law,LawFirm,"Am I making too many mistakes? How can I stop? Hey everyone,

I made a post here a couple of weeks ago about starting a new job. While it's been alright, I'm specifically struggling with billing a lot. We have quite a few bills (in the hundreds) to do a month, and we have to manually mark them up, send an approval email to the lawyer and then send them out to the client.

I'm still studying at uni and only working part-time (common in Australia). I've started doing some of the billing last week. Today (on my non-working day) I got a bunch of calls on Microsoft teams and some emails from a client about a bill, that they were billed too much. Another client, turns out I used an old email address, so I have to go through past emails on iManage to see the most current one. So far these are the two mistakes so far but they've rattled me. I have final exams next week so everything is just so hectic right now.

I like the firm, it's a pretty large firm, but the billing is really giving me tons of anxiety. I'm still very new here and I'm worried I can't pay attention to detail well enough to excel in this role. What also worries me is that I'll be the one doing most of the billing for this month (at the end of month) because a couple others are going on leave, and we're also short one full-time legal secretary.

Data should be kept up to date in iManage (or whatever practice management software is being used). If someone was informed of the new address and didn’t update the information, how were you supposed to know?

Overbilling? Is the client just whinging, or did you legitimately somehow bill too much?

1op4fyn,Law,LawFirm,"Smokeball billing - best practices I've been using Smokeball for a few years and I still can't figure out how best to bill time and review/correct it on a daily basis. Every time I invoice a matter, it's a mess full of duplicative auto-time entries. To counter this, I've been in the habit of keeping a contemporaneous, separate record of ""real"" time in Toggl and copying/comparing entries later when it's billing time. Sometimes, the issue is that I will spend 15 minutes drafting or revising a quick motion, but I will draft three documents and open ten PDFs, which auto-logs 1.3+ hours. 

The app-level 'Time and Expenses' view mixes in autotime with other time entries and regularly logs 15-20 hours per day uncorrected. Annoyingly, I can't sort by matter number in this view, so it's hard to tell which entries I should delete to get the time down to a reasonable daily number.

I've tried monitoring the app-level ""Activity"" view which conveniently breaks down autotime by hour of the day, but it excludes time entries inputted using the built-in timer.

Looking at matter-level T&E isn't terribly useful unless I keep an outside record of working on a matter.

nn8vlue,Law,LawFirm,"nan The key is friction-less because time entry equals money.

At my old firm, we had timekeeping software. The managing partner and your practice group leader were notified daily on who had entered their time on that day. If you weren't entering it as you went, you lost time and were cheating yourself and the firm. I lobbied to have my assistant have access to my timekeeping app so I could dictate the time entry along with the substantive dictation, letter, motion , etc. That was a huge boost.

When i went solo, i took Jay Foonbergs advice in how to start and build a law practice and had several photographs of my family facing me on my desk.

nnnzlrh,Law,LawFirm,"nan I stepped into a similar role about a year ago. I came into a mid-sized firm (around 20 staff) to help clean up operations, tech, and workflow. The biggest early lesson? Law firms have a lot of invisible complexity that doesn’t show up in other industries, approvals, matter tracking, billing, compliance, document storage, you name it. Everything’s technically “digital” but still heavily manual. The best thing I did early on was map out every recurring process: intake assignment - drafting - approval - billing - archiving. Once you see it visually, you can identify where time actually disappears (hint: it’s rarely in the billable work).   
We tested a few tools along the way Clio, Actionstep, and later Iqidis. Iqidis stuck the longest because it didn’t try to replace lawyers; it automated all the small, admin-heavy steps between tools. Stuff like routing documents for approval, pulling data into templates, or syncing signed contracts into the right folders automatically.  
It still needs setup time and buy-in, but if you’re coming from another industry and already comfortable with systems/process design, you’ll pick it up fast. I’d just say: focus first on mapping the workflows, then layer in the tech. Otherwise, you’ll end up automating bad processes.

1oqwu9y,Law,Paralegal,"Immigration firms, do you also think the currently available tools are (kind of) lacking? I realize I might get downvoted for this, but I really feel that the existing immigration practice and case management tool offerings are severely lacking in depth. I have a health tech background and I’m surprised by how basic and surface-level most of these tools are when it comes to feature sets and overall capabilities. For example, reporting is basic and only works for elementary filters. Task management is more of a simple check list without any additional attributes/automations. 

They also feel rigid to me in terms of workflows and how you must track tasks, manage matters etc. The standard alternative seems to be to go to generic tools like Clio at the cost of immigration being just another “module” rather than being the centerpiece.

Of course I don’t mean to say that they are bad or useless tools, the overly glowing reviews for each them indicate that they’re the best thing ever, but to me it looks like they leave a lot to be desired. It also doesn’t help that these tools gatekeep many essential features behind packages that you have to pay up extra for. For example user permissions shouldn’t require the most expensive plan that’s available.

1op6dss,Law,Paralegal,"Case Management Software I am a litigation paralegal at a small plaintiff's PI firm. We are currently using Neos and my boss HATES it. He only switched because he was using Needles and they forced him to switch. Prior to moving here earlier this year, I had only used Clio, including their PI plug-in, for about 7 years, so that's the extent of my experience with other platforms. What is everyone using these days for case management? We handle PI (including medmal, nursing home, wrongful death, etc.) and workers' comp, and since we handle wrongful death, sometimes handle estates as well. We have 2 attorneys, 3 paralegals, and an office admin.

Our biggest gripes/needs are:

* Glitchy Outlook plugin - doesn't ""update"" to the correct message as you click around and frequently saves the wrong email (e.g., the last email you were on, not the one you're currently viewing)
   * Clio's Outlook plugin can be slow, and if you move to the next email before it finishes saving, it can save the wrong message, but it's far less of a problem.
* Outlook plugin's ""Send and Tag"" feature doesn't work with classic Outlook, and barely works with new Outlook.
   * I like Clio's Outlook plugin for this -- how it auto-populates a matter-specific email address in the BCC instead of sending the email for you.
* Unlimited document storage with customizable structure
   * I loved Clio for this -- unlimited storage included and you could add folders and subfolders as needed, plus little to no limit on file naming, etc.
   * Neos, in comparison, has a HORRIBLE document management system and requires link to external storage such as SharePoint.
* Built-in communications features
   * Texting with clients that automatically saves to the matter
   * Intra-office messaging that I could actually convince everyone to use (would be helpful if it sends the message in an email to the recipient so they know they received a message, but also displays some sort of notification or clear inbox on the main dashboard or something with all your unread messages -- but also a way to clear them out once they're addressed so they don't just linger)
   * Some sort of client portal where they can message with you and access or upload important documents or information.
* Customizable data collection
   * Customizing the information that's displayed on the main case information screen
   * Additional tabs or something (I do like Neos for this) for contacts, counsel (ideally with separate categories for counsel and paralegals), medical providers and bills/records tracking, expenses and settlement details, etc.
   * Ability to add a company association to a contact and then click the company and see all associated contacts (I liked Clio for this -- Neos requires you to make contact associations or groups or whatever)
* As much automation as humanly possible
   * Easy-to-build forms (loved Clio for this -- the custom fields were super easy to understand and put into a Word document form, but their reliance on manual entry for contact types in a matter, the fact that all contacts were simply listed in one long list, and excessive custom fields could make this a bit cumbersome sometimes)
   * Automatically calendaring deadlines
      * For example, if I log that we received discovery requests and enter the deadline to respond, having that automatically show up on the calendar (I have a custom tab set up in Neos for tracking pleadings and discovery since my boss's organization in the file system drives me nuts and makes things hard to find, would be lovely if entering the response deadline there auto-populated on the calendar)
   * Robust task lists and task management
      * Automatic reminders or automatic follow ups, flexibility for multiple different child tasks depending on the route a case takes, that sort of thing
      * Also no requiring you to mark a task complete for the deadline for the child task to populate (Neos drives me nuts with this -- if I update the date of the ""summons issued"" task and then mark it complete, it puts the child task deadline based on the date I marked it complete, if different from the date I set it before doing that. In contrast, Clio was great for this, setting deadlines based on the date of a task, not the date it was marked complete).
* Matter numbering system -- currently we manually assign a matter number within a spreadsheet that is our printer code for that matter, and that has to be manually added to a field within the matter in Neos. Neos assigns a totally different matter number (admittedly, I'm not really familiar with how they set that up to begin with). Would love to be able to set a start number for new matters and have that match up with the printer code so it's all one number across the board that we can use to reference matters without using client names, etc.
* Mobile app - I loved that I could pull up the Clio app on my phone or iPad and navigate it fairly easily. Hate that for Neos, I have to use my browser and it does not show up well at all on anything other than a computer. 

I'm sure there are more, but this is already ridiculously long. Please drop any suggestions you have and ideally, why you recommend them!

plaintiffs pi firm we are currently using neos and my boss hates it he only switched because he was using needles and they forced him to switch prior to moving here earlier this year i had only used clio including their pi plugin for about years so thats the extent of my experience with other platforms what is everyone using these days for case management we handle pi including medmal nursing home wrongful death etc and workers comp and since we handle wrongful death sometimes handle estates as well we have attorneys paralegals and an office admin our biggest gripesneeds are glitchy outlook plugin doesnt update to the correct message as you click around and frequently saves the wrong email eg the last email you were on not the one youre currently viewing clios outlook plugin can be slow and if you move to the next email before it finishes saving it can save the wrong message but its far less of a problem outlook plugins send and tag feature doesnt work with classic outlook and barely works with new outlook i like clios outlook plugin for this how it autopopulates a matterspecific email address in the bcc instead of sending the email for you unlimited document storage with customizable structure i loved clio for this unlimited storage included and you could add folders and subfolders as needed plus little to no limit on file naming etc neos in comparison has a horrible document management system and requires link to external storage such as sharepoint builtin communications features texting with clients that automatically saves to the matter intraoffice messaging that i could actually convince everyone to use would be helpful if it sends the message in an email to the recipient so they know they received a message but also displays some sort of notification or clear inbox on the main dashboard or something with all your unread messages but also a way to clear them out once theyre addressed so they dont just linger some sort of client portal where they can message with you and access or upload important documents or information customizable data collection customizing the information thats displayed on the main case information screen additional tabs or something i do like neos for this for contacts counsel ideally with separate categories for counsel and paralegals medical providers and billsrecords tracking expenses and settlement details etc ability to add a company association to a contact and then click the company and see all associated contacts i liked clio for this neos requires you to make contact associations or groups or whatever as much automation as humanly possible easytobuild forms loved clio for this the custom fields were super easy to understand and put into a word document form but their reliance on manual entry for contact types in a matter the fact that all contacts were simply listed in one long list and excessive custom fields could make this a bit cumbersome sometimes automatically calendaring deadlines for example if i log that we received discovery requests and enter the deadline to respond having that automatically show up on the calendar i have a custom tab set up in neos

nnn2dpo,Construction,Construction,"nan File organization chaos is how mistakes happen and money gets lost. You need a system before this gets worse.

First, pick one central storage location. Google Drive, Dropbox, SharePoint, whatever. Just pick one and force everyone to use it. Stop letting files live on individual computers or phones. Our contractors who fixed this problem made it clear that if a file isn't in the shared system, it doesn't exist.

Set up a consistent folder structure for every project. Something like: Project Name / Drawings / Estimates / Permits / Invoices / Photos / Correspondence. Same structure every time so people know where to find stuff without asking. Add subfolders as needed but keep the top level consistent.

For version control, use proper file naming. ProjectName\_Drawing\_Rev01\_Date.pdf instead of just ""drawing final FINAL v2 actual final.pdf"" that everyone does. Date stamps and revision numbers prevent confusion about which version is current.

Make one person responsible for uploading and organizing files for each project. When everyone just throws stuff in folders randomly, it turns into a disaster. One person owns the file structure and keeps it clean.

For shared editing, use cloud based tools that handle version control automatically. Google Docs for text, Bluebeam or similar for plan markups. Stops the problem of five people editing five different copies of the same estimate.

Photos need metadata. Location, date, what phase of work. Either use apps that auto tag or create dated subfolders. ""Site Photos 2025-11-08"" beats a folder with 3000 random phone pictures.

Stop using email attachments for project files. Email them a link to the shared folder instead. Cuts down on outdated versions floating around in inboxes.

He would like to have a local server/workstation that both of them can connect to remotely and work from using Remote Desktop, with all the required software installed centrally.

My initial idea was to set up a workstation in the workshop and allow remote access through a VPN + Remote Desktop. Cloud solutions like AWS or Azure aren’t ideal because the cost is too high for such a small business.

1ord3rd,Tech,sysadmin,"Engineer versus Architect? Hey there. I know titles are meaningless and stupid. But my company is rigid in pay brackets and the titles justify what those brackets are. Our HR stubbornly values head management over tech and skill sets - so there is always this stupid battle of you don't have 'direct reports' so how can you make more than someone who manages a bunch of 'jobs not related to IT'?

Anyway we're a medium sized company - 20 locations, 500 endpoints, 400 staff (150 are remote) , my title is system engineer and I wear many hats. Pay bracket for my position tops out at $93k CAD + pension and bonus (4-8% average in my 5 years here). From what I gather the pay is on the low end for Canada, and the low-med range for my region.

Some of the things I've done/am responsible for. IT strategy from top is ""we don't want on-prem with such a decentralized company but so many locations to manage hardware at. We also don't like AD because it's old."" Also need to be very flexible because we're acquiring companies left right and center and may double/triple our size in the next 5 years.

* How we get there is entirely up to me. I could have just lifted and shifted every hyper-v VM, but I set up an Azure environment, created a NVA with UTM policies, designed workload routing, connected it to our Zscaler ZPA and designed the apps and RBAC, built Azure Virtual Desktop as entra only and intune joined, migrated apps from on prem to AzureSQL and managed instance, decided all of the configuration, scaling, etc... with full autonomy. Built container apps, app registry, set up docker images.
* Our Hyper-V setup is 4 hypervisors across 2 sites with backups and replication going in each direction.
* Our ISP manages most of our Zscaler, but config requests come from us, so I am responsible for that.
* Responsible for switch config we have Catalyst 9xxx in every location
* Almost anything in M365 - Set up Intune/autopilot - vendor straight to user zero IT touch device provisioning.
* Migrating acquired companies tenants to our own - happens once per year
* Soon to be setting up Fabric/Onelake with private endpoint in Azure for our data team
* Implemented conditional access and created a migration plan for security key passwordless sign in with complete autonomy on every decision and configuration - now fully enforced for all users.
* Next year a big one will be 802.1x - how we do it is entirely up to me. Mostly likely scepman in Azure pushed with Intune, and configuring authentication policies on the switches.
* All of these things also set up for Azure log analytics so our security team can ingest it to the SIEM

nnsi7qp,Tech,sysadmin,"nan Thanks, appreciate your thoughts.

For a little more context, we're a financial institution (credit union) and on the road to becoming NIST CSF 2.0 org, and our cybersecurity team is very fresh - one person whose role so far has basically been reviewing vendor SOC2's. We're hiring 2 more now, so it's been on me and the other engineer to ensure the stuff being built is compliant.

When it comes to the Azure stuff, while it was our ultimate strategy it came about this quickly because finance dept basically purchased an a very old school and expensive asp.net app that required on-prem RDS. I had to write documents intended for tech and finance c suites to come up with the compromise that it would be on Entra only AVD with Azure SQL, outlining risks and how the options align with strategy. 

The vendor provides the tool to dozens of peer companies and we're literally the first to put it in Azure - they weren't even certain it would work but were willing to try. Let alone without Active Directory involved. Otherwise the only solution for them would be to put it on a physical privileged box in one of our offices, that their entirely remote team would have to physically be at to access, we weren't going to invest in on-prem RDS nor do we have any configuration set up for that.

Azure virtual desktop wasn't even something we were considering up until this point.

Coincidentally a vendor that companies in our region relied on for some banking api data decided to get out of the business. We're the largest in the region so we took them on. Their data factory is based on python and sql, and they have it all on a COLO, the initial plan when they were coming on board was to pay the colo to duplicate the environment. But that would involve new networking appliances and big networking changes at all of our branches. I convinced them that I'd work with the dev to get it connected to an Azure SQL managed instance and get their workflow to work on Azure virtual desktop - this is what I'm currently in the midst of.


And you're right on the last point. Part of why this is coming up is I applied for a manager job at a smaller peer company. It's a decent pay bump and even more hats. My manager is on the same page as me and wants to keep me, but I'm not confident HR who ultimately micromanages all position/personnel/pay band decisions won't stamp it.","['active directory', 'azure']",thanks appreciate your thoughts for a little more context were a ficial institution credit union and on the road to becoming nist csf org and our cybersecurity team is very fresh one person whose role so far has basically been reviewing vendor socs were hiring more now so its been on me and the other engineer to ensure the stuff being built is compliant when it comes to the azure stuff while it was our ultimate strategy it came about this quickly because fice dept basically purchased an a very old school and expensive aspnet app that required onprem rds i had to write documents intended for tech and fice c suites to come up with the compromise that it would be on entra only avd with azure sql outlining risks and how the options align with strategy the vendor provides the tool to dozens of peer companies and were literally the first to put it in azure they werent even certain it would work but were willing to try let alone without active directory involved otherwise the only solution for them would be to put it on a physical privileged box in one of our offices that their entirely remote team would have to physically be at to access we werent going to invest in onprem rds nor do we have any configuration set up for that azure virtual desktop wasnt even something we were considering up until this point coincidentally a vendor that companies in our region relied on for some banking api data decided to get out of the business were the largest in the region so we took them on their data factory is based on python and sql and they have it all on a colo the initial plan when they were coming on board was to pay the colo to duplicate the environment but that would involve new networking appliances and big networking changes at all of our branches i convinced them that id work with the dev to get it connected to an azure sql managed instance and get their workflow to work on azure virtual desktop this is what im currently in the midst of and youre right on the last point part of why this is coming up is i applied for a manager job at a smaller peer company its a decent pay bump and even more hats my manager is on the same page as me and wants to keep me but im not confident hr who ultimately micromanages all positionpersonnelpay band decisions wont stamp it,positive

\-The 2nd one involved Implementation of SD-WAN solution using Fortinet products, configuring FortiGate security polices & profiles, every device in this internship was virtualized using VMware workstation

My Immich instance (port 2283) on the same machine is reachable from every device on my LAN, including my iPhone and Raspberry Pi, but Frigate on 50005 consistently times out from any other host.



Here’s what I’ve tested so far:

	•	Verified the container is bound to all interfaces – docker ps shows 0.0.0.0:50005->5000/tcp.

	•	Confirmed the Mac can reach that port locally, so Docker networking is fine.

	•	From the Pi, curl [http://192.168.1.19:2283](http://192.168.1.19:2283) returns the Immich page, but curl :50005 hangs. ping to the Mac fails (expected with macOS stealth mode).

	•	Ran tcpdump -i en1 port 50005 on the Mac: I see SYN packets arriving from the Pi, but the Mac never replies – meaning the packets reach the host but are dropped locally.

	•	Disabled macOS “Stealth Mode”, turned the firewall off, and even disabled LuLu, but its network extension (com.objective-see.lulu.extension) still shows as active due to System Integrity Protection; can’t unload it without rebooting or full uninstall.

	•	Changing the port in docker-compose from 50005 to 8080 didn’t help either.

As someone with presence at all levels of IT and systems support through the last couple decades, though... I have read through your posts. Genuinely, I think you may have a bit of a communication issue that is coming through during interviews.

I see a lot of random references to various skills you have. Those skills are beneficial. What is not beneficial is bouncing around between acronyms, unrelated systems, personal gripes and complaints, in an effort to make yourself heard. Much of your speech is very personally and emotionally oriented.

This can FEEL good to you, and FEEL good to the customer on the other end, and you can chat about whatever and talk over their heads with jargon to make you both feel like you know what you're talking about, but have your little mini-rants that make you feel personable. My experience is that people with this combination are actually very poor employees. They put a lot of weight on their 'I get along with people, look at my personality' vibes, and their 'I cannot figure out this problem because it's beneath my level, I can patch Linux servers with my eyes closed' assumptions, and things just do not >>>GET DONE<<<.

1oqh4qq,Tech,sysadmin,"Student Sysadmin here. My boss is retiring soon, and I want to apply for his full-time position. How can I best prepare? TL;DR: I’m a junior IT/Cybersecurity student working as a Helpdesk/Sysadmin in my university’s CS department. One of our two full-time Sysadmins is retiring this summer, and I’m planning to apply for the role. I’ve got about six months to prepare. What would you focus on to make the best impression?



For some history, I am currently a college student studying IT and Cybersecurity at a pretty good university. I am a Junior, and plan on graduating in April of 2027. I got really lucky about two years ago and found an opening for a helpdesk/Sysadmin position in my university's computer science department, and was able to get it. I've worked here for about 2.5 years, and have been able to lead a ton of major projects. I do about 30% helpdesk, 30% general security work (small audits, patching vulnerabilities, etc.), and about 40% designing, building, and managing production systems. 

One of our two full time Sysadmins is getting ready to retire sometime this upcoming summer, and the other encouraged us student employees to apply if we're interested. Most of my coworkers are not going to apply, but I'd like to throw my hat in the ring and just try my best. I figure that the worst case scenario is that I end up being more prepared for a full time job after graduation anyway. 

I've got about six months to prepare, and want to make the most of it. I don't currently have any certifications (money is tight), but I'm open to working towards some if you think it will make a difference. 

If you were in my shoes right now, how would you be preparing? What would you focus on? What would make a hiring committee take me seriously for a full Sysadmin role while I’m still finishing my degree? The full timer who is not retiring started his career at my university working in a full time sysadmin position while finishing his degree, so I think if anyone would understand it would be him. 



**What I'm already doing:**

Right now, I feel like I'm doing a decent amount of stuff outside of work. I have a good homelab, where I experiment with the same technologies I use at work. It's pretty developed, and I'm currently working on getting it documented and posted online. I run my college's cybersecurity competition team (one of the best in the nation). I teach weekly lessons to younger college students about cybersecurity, network engineering, and general sysadmin topics. 

At work I also try my best to learn the systems and concepts that no one else does. We've had a perfectly working Ansible server for a few months now, and I'm the only person learning how to actually use it. I try to be friendly and helpful when helping users and responding to tickets, which we've had struggles with in the past. I also am generally the guy that people go to when asking security related questions.

1oqg91j,Tech,sysadmin,"O365 keeps flipping all users’ primary SMTP to *.onmicrosoft.com whenever I add a new domain (Okta-federated + AADConnect + .local + NO on-prem Exchange) Looking for help because Microsoft support has gone in circles on this.

Whenever I add a new accepted domain in Microsoft 365, all of my users suddenly get their primary SMTP switched to the tenant’s *.onmicrosoft.com address. I’m not making the new domain primary — literally just adding it — and Exchange Online immediately restamps everybody.

Here’s the environment:

On-prem AD domain: corp.local

Azure AD tenant domain: tenantname.onmicrosoft.com

External domains: companyA.com, companyB.com, etc.

Federation: Okta → Azure AD

Directory sync: AAD Connect (syncing users from on-prem)

No on-prem Exchange anymore; it was decommissioned years ago

Because of Okta federation, I can’t change the M365 default domain

Because on-prem is .local, UPNs don’t match any routable domain

Adding any accepted domain in M365 causes Exchange Online to rewrite all users’ primary SMTP → *.onmicrosoft.com


I have to manually revert everyone, which obviously isn’t sustainable.

Things tried:

Changing AAD default domain (blocked by federation)

Updating UPNs to routable domain (breaks legacy onprem apps)

Set Adsync to audit mode (I don't see the changes)

Multiple Microsoft tickets → no useful direction


The questions:

1. Has anyone seen this SMTP rewriting behavior in an Okta-federated + AADConnect + no on-prem Exchange setup?


2. Is this happening because Exchange Online thinks it’s still in hybrid mode but no on-prem Exchange exists?


3. Does the .local on-prem domain + non-routable UPN force EXO to fall back to onmicrosoft.com during domain changes?


4. Is there any supported way to add accepted domains without EXO rewriting the primary SMTP for the whole tenant?


5. Is the real fix rebuilding the hybrid relationship or faking an on-prem Exchange just so I can manage email address policies again?



Feels like I’m stuck in a half-in/half-out hybrid state that Exchange Online doesn’t know how to handle.

1oqeky6,Tech,sysadmin,"Sanity Check: Divorcing Services from DC with Dissimilar Hardware (SSD/HDD) Hey everyone,

Looking for a sanity check here. Quick disclaimer: I'm not a sysadmin by trade. I'm in this role at our small 3D studio because no one else can do it. We have a contracted IT guy, but he only handles the core Active Directory config and doesn't touch our render farm or do any day-to-day management. I'm the ""boots on the ground"" guy for administration, even though my formal role is a technical art director/illustrator/animator

We just had a drive failure on a server, so I'm using this as an opportunity to improve our architecture - a big part of the problem is getting my boss (CEO of the company) to understand the risks of what we currently have and the benefits of putting in the effort now to improve everything. I'd really appreciate some feedback from other professionals on my proposed plan.

Here's the current setup:

* Server 1 (DCSRV01): Dell PowerEdge R540 (Windows Server 2019) with an all-SSD RAID array.

* Server 2 (New-but-old): Dell PowerEdge R730xd (rebuilding) with an all-HDD RAID array, booting off 2x SSD in RAID-1.

* Clients: 8 workstations, 19 render nodes.

The Problem:

Our R540 (DCSRV01) is a single point of failure running on bare metal. It is currently acting as our:

* Primary Domain Controller
* File Server (the ""Projects"" share, \\dcsrv01\projects)
* Deadline Repository
* License Server (v-ray, forest pack, railclone, tyflow, etc... we're an Autodesk 3ds Max shop)

This setup has so many problems and vulnerabilities -

* I can't just reboot the main server to do security or software updates because that disrupts our render farm and file server. The server hasn't been rebooted or updated in months, if not more than a year.
* Security risk - we had a cyber attack a few years ago (from a US-based group sponsored by the iranian government believe it or not!), back when we hosted our own exchange server, and even though the major risks are better, we are still at risk of something catastrophic happening if someone clicks a bad link in the email.
* Hard-coded paths. Managing the render farm requires that all the machines on the network have UNC paths directly to the file server. Which isn't terrible, but upgrading hardware is a pain in the butt.

Proposed Solution

My goal is to divorce these services for security and manageability, while keeping high-I/O services (Projects share, Deadline) on the fast SSD array.

Phase 1 - On the R730xd (HDD Server) that just died:

* Install Windows Server 2022 + Hyper-V.
* Create DC02 (VM): This will be our new Redundant Domain Controller.
* Create a local backup server (VM) using the large HDD array for storage.

Phase 2: On the R540 (our current, and sole, DC, with SSDs):

* Add the Hyper-V role to the existing Windows Server 2019 OS.
* Create a new VM for dedicated file serving via SMB - let's call it FS01.
* Store this VM's virtual disk on the host's all-SSD RAID to maintain performance.
* Migrate our main ""Projects"" share, Deadline Repository, and License Servers into this FS01 VM.

Phase 3: Networking (this is the part I have the least experience with):

* Install DFS Namespaces on both DCSRV01 and DCSRV02.
* Create a new virtual path, e.g., \\ourdomain.local\Shares\Projects.
* Point this DFS path to the new share on \\FS01\Projects.
* Do a one-time, painful update of all client mapped drives and registry keys to use the new DFS path.

Questions:

Am I crazy? Is this a sound plan? Am I missing any major gotchas, especially with virtualizing the file server (FS01) on the same physical host as the primary DC (DCSRV01)? (My thinking is that at least they are isolated in different OS instances). Is there a better way to approach this with the hardware I have?

Any tips of getting the bossman to agree to all this even though he's not a networking guy?

You'll want to ensure Windows Store is enabled with GPO or Registry, as well as Disable ""Do not connect to any Windows update Internet locations"". If you want to automate the installs you can try Winget and use the MS Store source. 

Alternatively you can install using the installation packages and dependencies, I didn't have any luck with the latest SnippingTool at the time though due to missing dependencies they haven't published.

Triple check your firewall isn't blocking the endpoints or blocking file downloads, Palo was categorizing APPX or MSIBUNDLE as ZIP files which was not helping.

nnp47du,Tech,msp,"nan We are a sophos partner so we'd accept the transfer into our partner portal, apply our standards and workflow and connectflex licensing.

It sounds like you are not a sophos partner, and this is a healthcare client. You should already have a managed solution in your pocket that you include vs taking on random firewall brands. For instance, if they had a sonicwall or fortinet, i would replace it at onboarding, even if i had to eat the cost.  If you're not familiar with a firewall brand, will be hard for you to even take it over and secure it. As mentioned elsewhere:

* External management portals (user and admin)
* internal portals (user and admin)
* Central access (even if you turn off those portals, central still has access, and is arguably the way to go)
* You need to license it or you lose some manageability (if they use msp licensing, it stops when their services stop, vs term licensing, which is applied to the firewall for X amount of years)
* Even if you magically got it into your central that you don't have yet and know how to lock all that down, they could still have it shipping logs/threat data or integrations data somewhere else, and you need to go chase that down and lock it/remove it.

It's almost easier to get a lay-of-the-land on the network and rebuild it from scratch to your sophos firewall config baseline, which it sounds like you don't have.

We're all bros here tonight so i'm not going to dive into that...just...It is BAD juju to manage a client, let alone a medical office, without a standard offering that you have nailed down. Do not just ""learn as you go""! Do you have a standard firewall offering you know in and out? It probably costs less than 3-4 hours worth of labor to replace this with that. And you're charging for the time to try and take this over right? right? So doing this is a bad idea for you and the client technically and financially. Which people here seem to love, doing bad ideas, so here's some actual help:

This is one of the most important things about the Sophos line (besides, seriously, using central. It's what makes them good imho): the access matrix. It tells you what is accessible from where and your goal is to get as little accessible from anywhere as possible:

nnp4n8q,Tech,msp,"nan It's common for MSP clients to not even have a sophos central account. You onboard the firewall into partner center and then assign it to the client (owned as and assigned to are different. Like the MSP could own it but assign to the client or both could be the client). You can make an account for central but they'd still have access above you.

The right way to do this (besides putting in a firewall you know) is becoming an msp connect flex sophos partner (which means you'll have to pass some basic training and get setup with a disty) and then accept the entire client into your MSP portal, which will give you access to the client and everything they have, including the firewall.",['firewall'],its common for msp clients to not even have a sophos central account you onboard the firewall into partner center and then assign it to the client owned as and assigned to are different like the msp could own it but assign to the client or both could be the client you can make an account for central but theyd still have access above you the right way to do this besides putting in a firewall you know is becoming an msp connect flex sophos partner which means youll have to pass some basic training and get setup with a disty and then accept the entire client into your msp portal which will give you access to the client and everything they have including the firewall,positive

nno5o3y,Tech,msp,"nan For clients with users licenses with Entra P2 I;

Create named locations for (2 sets for each 1x GPS and 1x IP based)

Always blocked countries (high risk regions)
Typical Countries
Allowed Travel Countries - Africa
Allowed Travel Countries - Asia
Allowed Travel Countries - Antarctica
Allowed Travel Countries - Oceana
Allowed Travel Countries - North America
Allowed Travel Countries - South America
Allowed Travel Countries - Europe.

I then created a corresponding security group, something like “travelling users - Asia” (we have naming conventions but use yours, e.g. SG-Auth-Temp-AsiaCountries). Internal processes to NEVER add users manually to these groups, but if not Entra p2 - you can do it this way instead of the way I explain below) 

These are populated based on discussions with the client which countries in each continent they would like users to access work apps from on a limited time based approach when required and gone through the approval flow.

CA polices ( which are persona based and targeted but simplified below). 2 policies for each, 1 is desktop (Linux, Windows) targeting the IP named locations, the other is mobile targeting GPS named locations.

Block logins from always blocked countries - no exceptions

Block logins from all countries except typical countries. All temporary travel security groups excluded from this policy.

Block logins from all countries except typical counties and allowed travel countries - Asia - target the temporary travel Asia security group 

*repeat policy above for each set of countries*

Then I create a corresponding access package for each set of travelling countries, configure who is allowed to request, approval flow (e.g. set of approves / line managers etc. whoever the client wants), when the access package is assigned the user gets added to the travel group, specify max access time, e.g 14 days, 21 days etc.

This way, if Entra P2, all CA exclusions:

Are client managed
Are temporary
Go through approval there end without our involvement 
Still ensure high risk countries are always blocked
Allowed temporary countries are reduced during time based access


Is it perfect? No. If a user is going to just Canada, it would be idea to only allow them to login from Canada during that time.

nnlv9ey,Tech,msp,"nan Disclosure upfront, I own an automation consultancy for MSPs, but I also still supervise an MSP, so I’ll put the latter hat on

We automated the user onboarding and endpoint onboardings nearly entirely with a combination of Rewst, CIPP, and ImmyBot. Designated managers at clients are given a contact type in CW PSA that grants them access to our self service portal in Rewst and assigns all their permissions. Then the can fill out onboarding and offboarding forms as needed. Internal facing forms lets our service team pre-fill certain things like default domains, licensing, etc, that will be the same for all users. Alternatively it can be tied to departments as well (Office staff get their groups and Business Premium assigned, warehouse staff get F3 licenses, etc). Forms are entirely dynamically generated for options to keep it on rails and easy for the end client

Once the form is submitted the user gets created, either on prem and then synced or directly in 365, licenses are assigned and acquired from distri if needed, and stuff like group/mailbox assignments, PSA contact creation, and user attributes are filled in parallel. On the designated start date, the manager gets a nice HTML formatted email with credentials wrapped in a PW Push link and a text with another PW Push and instructions is sent to the user. 

Endpoints are part of this too and really fun when you tie in Immy and CIPP. CIPP pushes out our standardized autopilot/Intune policies as a standards template to all customers to stage it up and manage drift. Then on the onboarding form we can provide a dropdown of service tags from autopilot to assign to the new user. This gets saved in an org variable. When the user gets the laptop and boots it up, it runs an installer for ImmyBot at OOBE as a device powershell script, which then populates it in Immy for onboarding. Immy sends a webhook to Rewst saying hey I got a new computer, rewst matches the service tag with the org variable to tie it to the user, then sends an onboarding command assigned to the user’s Entra account. This installs all our standard tools and any department specific apps assigned to azure groups and sets up the primary user. After about 20-30 min at an enrollment page you’re dumped at an Entra login screen, user logs in and registers Windows Hello for Business, and they’re ready to start working with all the apps and policies they need. 

Offboarding runs effectively the same, client contact picks the user to offboard, sets the date, has the option to delegate mailbox/onedrive, and a toggle to wipe the device. At the scheduled offboard time it starts terminating accounts and sends an Intune wipe command to get the device ready for repurposing. OneDrive data is copied to a sharepoint library and access to that folder and the converted shared mailbox is sent to the delegated user. 

Best part? Rewst makes the ticket, puts in notes for each step, tracks time into the ticket, and closes it with a nice recap email to the client. Our technicians don’t need to lift a finger for any of that, barring a few special clients who need more white glove on day 1 for crappy LoB apps, and those clients have the ticket automatically dispatched to a tech’s calendar at the start date with docs linked in an internal note.

nncv4py,Tech,msp,"nan (Heads up, cellular networks are my jam) In cellular there is no one provider works the best everywhere. There are so many factors at play that most people don’t know about that cause experience to vary even from one city block to the next. From tower distance, cellular frequency bands and channel width being used by each carrier in each county which varies, backhaul being provided to each provider at each tower, density of the area of homes, businesses, schools versus tower density. Which carrier is the most popular and thus the most loaded in the area. Where the cellular modem will be physically inside the building (tower might be outside but IDF Closet might be a floor underground in a concrete building where nothing cellular makes it in). The only sure fire way to verify. Is to test with all 3 (if in the US) of the big carriers.

If a client is willing/wanting a redundant connection and there are not secondary wireline options available. I do a site survey with 3 of the same phone with the latest cellular modem (Snapdragon X85 iPhone 17 pro’s or S25’s) one from each carrier on their highest end unlimited plan that way you’ll know what the “best” possible outcome will be from each. Go into the location of their firewall and run a speedtest from each of the carriers phones. Do a few for averaging. Note the time of day. Some providers might be super fast at 3am when no one is around but slow to a crawl between 12-6p. If it’s working good at 5pm odds are it will be working faster at 2am. And then after having gathered which carriers test good and bad. Present the client with the option from the carrier that works best for their location. 

(At least in the US) all 3 of the big carriers offer modems included with their business cellular internet plans. I like to use those and just bridge them into the clients firewall so that if it becomes defective, the carrier overnight swaps it for free. And I don’t have to deal with having to have spare hardware on standby that can quickly become outdated as cellular advancements take place (5G SA, 5G-Advanced, 5G Slicing, etc) the carrier just provides what works best (and is most compatible with their Static IP offerings).",['firewall'],heads up cellular networks are my jam in cellular there is no one provider works the best everywhere there are so many factors at play that most people dont know about that cause experience to vary even from one city block to the next from tower distance cellular frequency bands and channel width being used by each carrier in each county which varies backhaul being provided to each provider at each tower density of the area of homes businesses schools versus tower density which carrier is the most popular and thus the most loaded in the area where the cellular modem will be physically inside the building tower might be outside but idf closet might be a floor underground in a concrete building where nothing cellular makes it in the only sure fire way to verify is to test with all if in the us of the big carriers if a client is willingwanting a redundant connection and there are not secondary wireline options available i do a site survey with of the same phone with the latest cellular modem snapdragon x iphone pros or ss one from each carrier on their highest end unlimited plan that way youll know what the best possible outcome will be from each go into the location of their firewall and run a speedtest from each of the carriers phones do a few for averaging note the time of day some providers might be super fast at am when no one is around but slow to a crawl between p if its working good at pm odds are it will be working faster at am and then after having gathered which carriers test good and bad present the client with the option from the carrier that works best for their location at least in the us all of the big carriers offer modems included with their business cellular internet plans i like to use those and just bridge them into the clients firewall so that if it becomes defective the carrier overnight swaps it for free and i dont have to deal with having to have spare hardware on standby that can quickly become outdated as cellular advancements take place g sa gadvanced g slicing etc the carrier just provides what works best and is most compatible with their static ip offerings,positive

nndq6c6,Tech,msp,"nan Hi everyone, I'm the CTO and co-founder of Keeper and this post got my attention. I discussed this with our support team and I found the ServiceNow case and looked through the history. I'm very sorry that you had a bad experience and we'll look for ways to improve the product based on the case.

For context, Keeper is a zero-knowledge platform. The vault records can only be decrypted by a user who has been authorized, either through being the owner of the data or being shared. Regardless of the software version, vault records can only be decrypted by a user who has been explicitly granted access either through ownership, record sharing, folder sharing, vault transfer, or other role enforcement policies set up in the tenant.

From the case history, it looks like our L1 support rep assisted the customer in tracking down records that were transferred via the “vault transfer” feature when an employee left, as well as records shared and records un-shared. There were also examples where a user saved passkeys to a shared record.

As many people have said here in the thread, the desktop app version 16.x was a very old version of the product and it's a good idea to push the latest updates to users. That said, there was never a bug in the app causing things to be shared at random. Any record that was shared in the past will still be shared upon updating to the new software.

While I was not a participant in this support case, I would be happy to work with the MSP to assist in any way that I can.

Keeper is continuously tested for vulnerabilities through our 3rd party testing and through our bug bounty program. We are also SOC2 and FedRAMP authorized, so we adhere to hundreds of security controls when building and releasing our software.

1oqce5x,Tech,talesfromtechsupport,"Red tape: Software cutover edition I recently read a great story from someone who - due to a large amount of red tape - had to produce documentation to support handing their application off to themselves. Reminded me of a software cutover tale. This isn't strictly tech support (mods, feel free to remove), but it seemed relevant.

Back when /the cloud/ was the new hotness, we were instructed to host our software at AWS. This is a big company. Several layers of management, project management, and architects descended upon us. Somehow my team was graced with being the first one to go, probably because we are unimportant. 

Spin up new infra in AWS. Briefly dual-host in the old datacenter as well as AWS while we learn the ropes and make sure we can deploy our web service. We declare that we're ready to go whenever.

Remember those layers of managers, project managers, and architects? Yeah, we're not used to that. Sure, this was a huge Fortune 100 company. The red tape is normal. But my team was small (I think it was like 4 developers total?), largely ignored (did I mention we're unimportant?), and inside a rogue division that operated like a startup. It was the first time we'd been exposed to the red tape from corporate.

As soon as we set a cutover date, some PM sent me a ton of questions and paperwork to fill out. Document the deployment process (uh ... hit ""Deploy"" on our build server?). Document the rollback process (we didn't have one - when there was a problem we'd make a change and deploy it). Who is the correct business contact who normally approves deployments? Uh, nobody. We just deploy. Who is the correct technical contact who normally approves deploys? Same answer. What architect do we work with? None. Which system do we use to log change tickets when we deploy? We don't. 

PM was not satisfied with my answers. Actually, that's an understatement. She was positively irate. Every box on that form needed a proper answer. 

Ok, fine. I'm the technical contact. I approve deployments. Reached out to my manager to use her as a business contact. The PM was not satisfied. ""You can't approve your own deployment!"". 

Ok, fine. I put down a coworker's name as the person who will be running the deployment. That makes it acceptable for me to provide technical approval, right? Picked another coworker as architect. I'm running low on coworkers at this point and the PM is annoyed that the ""architect"" doesn't have a job title that includes the word ""architect"", but at this point she's starting to sound resigned. Entered a user story in our work tracking software to perform the cutover. The PM doesn't have access to our work tracking software (she's from corporate and my division does our own thing, remember), so she doesn't know that it's not a change request. 

After spending many hours attempting to document our nonexistent processes, we finally got the go-ahead. The PM and a couple middle managers joined a call. ""{boss}, do we have your approval as business owner?"" Yeah sure. ""{me}, do we have your approval as technical owner?"" Yeah sure. ""{coworker}, go ahead and start the deployment.""

We waited 90 awkward seconds while the deployment happened. Long seconds, with way too many people on the call. It worked. 

The cutover felt exactly as anticlimactic as the end of my story. Nothing interesting happened. We were done, time for the next team to move their stuff over. But I definitely spent more time filling out paperwork and arguing about processes with the PM and management than I actually spent on this ""huge"" migration.",['aws'],red tape software cutover edition i recently read a great story from someone who due to a large amount of red tape had to produce documentation to support handing their application off to themselves reminded me of a software cutover tale this isnt strictly tech support mods feel free to remove but it seemed relevant back when the cloud was the new hotness we were instructed to host our software at aws this is a big company several layers of management project management and architects descended upon us somehow my team was graced with being the first one to go probably because we are unimportant spin up new infra in aws briefly dualhost in the old datacenter as well as aws while we learn the ropes and make sure we can deploy our web service we declare that were ready to go whenever remember those layers of managers project managers and architects yeah were not used to that sure this was a huge fortune company the red tape is normal but my team was small i think it was like developers total largely ignored did i mention were unimportant and inside a rogue division that operated like a startup it was the first time wed been exposed to the red tape from corporate as soon as we set a cutover date some pm sent me a ton of questions and paperwork to fill out document the deployment process uh hit deploy on our build server document the rollback process we didnt have one when there was a problem wed make a change and deploy it who is the correct business contact who normally approves deployments uh nobody we just deploy who is the correct technical contact who normally approves deploys same answer what architect do we work with none which system do we use to log change tickets when we deploy we dont pm was not satisfied with my answers actually thats an understatement she was positively irate every box on that form needed a proper answer ok fine im the technical contact i approve deployments reached out to my manager to use her as a business contact the pm was not satisfied you cant approve your own deployment ok fine i put down a coworkers name as the person who will be running the deployment that makes it acceptable for me to provide technical approval right picked another coworker as architect im running low on coworkers at this point and the pm is annoyed that the architect doesnt have a job title that includes the word architect but at this point shes starting to sound resigned entered a user story in our work tracking software to perform the cutover the pm doesnt have access to our work tracking software shes from corporate and my division does our own thing remember so she doesnt know that its not a change request after spending many hours attempting to document our nonexistent processes we finally got the goahead the pm and a couple middle managers joined a call boss do we have your approval as business owner yeah sure me do we have your approval as technical owner yeah sure coworker go ahead and start the deployment we waited awkward seconds while the deployment happened long seconds with way too many people on the call it worked the cutover felt exactly as anticlimactic as the end of my story nothing interesting happened we were done time for the next team to move their stuff over but i definitely spent more time filling out paperwork and arguing about processes with the pm and management than i actually spent on this huge migration,positive

Your story is something I go through every couple of months.  Same super-large corporate customer wants us to file change requests in their change management system when they want something in production, but it's all even worse than you described.  Technical and business contacts have to be their staff, and are different on every project, and are always impossible to figure out who they are and track down.  Then there needs to be a whole horde of jiras associated with the change, but we as external contractors don't have access to their jira system, so that's a whole other round of hunting and poking people.  Then it usually gets rejected three times because they changed the process and required information from the last time but we don't find out because we don't work there.

1oqh2ny,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"Student Sysadmin here. My boss is retiring soon, and I want to apply for his full-time position. How can I best prepare? TL;DR: I’m a junior IT/Cybersecurity student working as a Helpdesk/Sysadmin in my university’s CS department. One of our two full-time Sysadmins is retiring this summer, and I’m planning to apply for the role. I’ve got about six months to prepare. What would you focus on to make the best impression?



For some history, I am currently a college student studying IT and Cybersecurity at a pretty good university. I am a Junior, and plan on graduating in April of 2027. I got really lucky about two years ago and found an opening for a helpdesk/Sysadmin position in my university's computer science department, and was able to get it. I've worked here for about 2.5 years, and have been able to lead a ton of major projects. I do about 30% helpdesk, 30% general security work (small audits, patching vulnerabilities, etc.), and about 40% designing, building, and managing production systems. 

One of our two full time Sysadmins is getting ready to retire sometime this upcoming summer, and the other encouraged us student employees to apply if we're interested. Most of my coworkers are not going to apply, but I'd like to throw my hat in the ring and just try my best. I figure that the worst case scenario is that I end up being more prepared for a full time job after graduation anyway. 

I've got about six months to prepare, and want to make the most of it. I don't currently have any certifications (money is tight), but I'm open to working towards some if you think it will make a difference. 

If you were in my shoes right now, how would you be preparing? What would you focus on? What would make a hiring committee take me seriously for a full Sysadmin role while I’m still finishing my degree? The full timer who is not retiring started his career at my university working in a full time sysadmin position while finishing his degree, so I think if anyone would understand it would be him. 



**What I'm already doing:**

Right now, I feel like I'm doing a decent amount of stuff outside of work. I have a good homelab, where I experiment with the same technologies I use at work. It's pretty developed, and I'm currently working on getting it documented and posted online. I run my college's cybersecurity competition team (one of the best in the nation). I teach weekly lessons to younger college students about cybersecurity, network engineering, and general sysadmin topics. 

At work I also try my best to learn the systems and concepts that no one else does. We've had a perfectly working Ansible server for a few months now, and I'm the only person learning how to actually use it.

1opmuhb,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"Getting BACK Into IT When Old... I started my career in IT. Loved it for the 5 year stint I did. That was 20 years ago though -- then I got sucked into tech marketing, then non-tech marketing, then financial services, CMO, COO, CEO (albeit of small companies, mostly ecommerce).   
  
And, frankly, I have hated every moment of it. Ok, maybe not EVERY moment, but I think I am just burnt out. Sure, the money is good. But the stress of making payroll for 50, 200, 500 people day in and day out takes a toll. Especially in this newly frozen and fearful economy.  
  
Here I am rounding the corner to 50 and I still homelab every single day, from networking to PVE to automation. I code small projects constantly, trying out new languages and new platforms. I keep up on cloud tech stacks, on linux and windows servers.   
  
I really enjoy my tech hobby, but considering how do I (and should I) make the transition back into the IT world? Will a resume full of marketing and executive responsibility just freak out potential hiring managers, who won't think I can take direction or think I'll just be a short termer?  How do I express my experience on the ol' resume in a way that gets me a step or two above the helpdesk, or am I starting back there again?

nn9v0n6,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"nan As already noted you're unlikely to find a lot of truly entry level jobs that are remote. A lot of tasks assigned to entry level people can't be done remotely (rack/stack equipment, image workstations, troubleshoot layer 1, etc.). There are a lot of ""remote jobs"" that are scams although I would note a job not appearing on the company website doesn't necessarily mean it isn't a real job. Especially right now a lot of companies are hiring contractors rather than direct hires because they're not sure that work is going to be needed long term and terminating contractors is easier. Getting budget approved for a 4-6 month contract is generally easier in most companies than approving to hire somebody. I have worked a few jobs over the years where in some cases everybody on a specific team I worked were contractors. You would NEVER see any job posting on the end client company website when they backfilled a contractor because it isn't a direct hire position. There are a few companies I have heard that rarely do direct hires for IT. There are obvious downsides to contractor roles. The benefits if any generally are poor compared to many direct hire positions so the pay rate really needs to be higher to reflect that in addition to the risk that the contract doesn't extend or covert. Job security is obviously worse because there is no guarantee of conversion to permanent even if they claim it is contract to hire and most companies are quicker to terminate contractors. If you have the experience they're generally something people avoid for those reasons, but starting out your may want to consider them just for the experience. Somebody that spent 6 months on a workstation refresh contract is going to have a much better chance at a permanent helpdesk job somewhere than someone with no formal experience.


That being said you do have to be wary of job scams these days. One key is to make sure that any email you get is from a legit source before wasting your time. Some will register a subtle typo of a legitimate company or staffing form. I have seen a few that just append -jobs to a legitimate company domain. Another tell is that the domain was only registered a few days ago. It is incredibly rare to spin up services for a domain that quickly in a legitimate business. Especially larger organizations there is a process to setting up public facing services. It is VERY common for scams though. I know some organizations for that reason will filter recently registered domains on their firewall for that reason. Also job scams often don't do real interviews.

1ooxo5l,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"I’d love some insight or advice 
Hey everyone,
I’m graduating this December with a B.A. in Homeland Security and have been trying to get into the cybersecurity field. Honestly, the job search has been more stressful than school itself.

I was always considered the technical person in my family I’ve always loved technology, watching hardware builds/refurbishing videos, and learning how things work, which eventually led me to cybersecurity and programming. Even though I chose Homeland Security out of my fear of calculus, I still took web dev and cyber courses in my undergrad. Sadly, I didn’t get any internships, no interviews, and all of them.

However, I’ve earned my Security+, am prepping for my CCNA(which i take in 3 weeks), and working toward Blue Team Level 1, getting hands-on with Splunk, Autopsy, DeepBlueCLI, TheHive, and have even been learning the ins and outs of Windows, Cisco, and Linux CLI.

Despite all that, I’ve applied to nearly 200 entry-level roles (SOC analyst, help desk, etc.) and haven’t landed a single interview. It’s discouraging; I’m passionate and have been spending essentially all my time off from work dedicated to developing my skills, but this job market feels impossible.

My long-term goals are to move into security consulting, pentesting, or security engineering. I’m documenting labs on my blog, grinding DFIR challenges on HackTheBox and CyberDefenders, and learning Python and JavaScript — with plans to pick up Rust, Go, and C++ once I have solidified my programming fundamentals.  I’m also eyeing CySa+, PNPT, and later cloud security certs (AZ-500, AWS SA, AWS Security) so I can understand Cloud Security and Design. I’ve even been contemplating taking the OSCP and CCNP Security if I’m able to afford them within the next 12 to 18 months. I don’t care how hard it may be to pass; I still want to try and do these things so I can leverage myself over other entry-level applicants, and because I’m interested and passionate about the subject. 
Even though I’m struggling financially(I make less than $1000 a month atm), I’m still investing what little I have into certs and projects because I believe in where I’m going. I just need that first chance to prove myself.

Any advice for someone trying to break through?

I just got hired in IT with no degree and only one half of the A+ done (passed Core 1, never took Core 2).

No shortcuts or luck here I just had actual skills to show. I’ve been learning to code on my own for a while and built a small portfolio of real projects. Nothing insane, but enough to show I could troubleshoot, think logically, and get things working.
And I also have experience in Azure/cloud environments. 

During the interview, they didn’t care that I didn’t have the full cert or a degree. They cared that I could explain how I solve problems and why I made certain choices in my projects. That’s what got me hired.

It’s kinda crazy because I know people who’ve gone tens of thousands into debt for a degree or bootcamp and still get turned down. I’m not saying school is bad it just feels like the system pushes credentials more than competence, when in reality experience > everything.

If you’re trying to get in, here’s what I learned:
	•	Build stuff. Even small projects count.
	•	Learn the concepts, not just the answers.
	•	Be able to talk through your thinking. That’s what impresses interviewers.
	•	Don’t wait for a job to start getting experience. Make your own.

Now that I’m in the door, I’m kinda wondering what to do next. Should I go back and finish Core 2 of the A+? Move on to Network+ or maybe cloud stuff because I have experience in Azure as well? Or should I just keep racking up experience and building projects while I’ve got momentum?

I'm not discounting your skills, effort, or ambition, however, there is a degree of luck involved because you need to find yourself in the right place at the right time with the right recruiter and right hiring manager who is willing to take a look at your resume. 

I have personally hired people with no degree or certs either, however again, in a sea of resumes, there's still luck involved. I would urge people who are coming into this to understand this is a singular datapoint. Not a trend. There are thousands just like OP who have done the same and come up empty time and time again. 

>I’m not saying school is bad it just feels like the system pushes credentials more than competence, when in reality experience > everything.

This is not a new concept especially in this sub. Assuming you have not held any IT work prior to this, real world production work experience is really hard to come by.

1omjsb2,Tech,ITCareerQuestions,"Aimming for blue team but needed help on roadmap or advice about what to do, what do not 

I’m 20 years old and in my last year of a Bachelor’s degree in Information Security. In Feb-March 2026 my university will send me to a partnership internship (like most unis do), but I honestly feel like I know nothing.

My main goal is to work in the Blue Team field, but I’ve never had any IT job before (not even help desk).

Here’s what I’ve done so far:

Got EX200 (RHCSA) from Red Hat

Got CCST from Cisco

Know most A+ stuff (just not a fan of CompTIA)

Currently doing Certified SOC Analyst (ECSA) course — started in September and ends in March 2026


The thing is:

1. My course feels a little bit slow. For the next 3 months we’ll just cover Windows and Linux (which I already know decently). Red Team starts in month 4, Blue Team in month 5, and lab building in month 6.


2. My university keeps telling us to find any kind of IT job, but I have no idea how I could get one with my current experience.


3. My programming skills are weak — should I start focusing on that more?


4. I was studying for Security+ in August but stopped because I don’t really like CompTIA. Not sure if it’s worth continuing.




I just don’t want to waste the next few months feeling lost or stuck. Any advice from people who’ve been in a similar situation would really help.

TL;DR:
20-year-old InfoSec student with RHCSA, CCST, and ECSA in progress. Never had an IT job, feeling behind before internship starts in Jan 2026.

1. Being able to ssh into it
2. Deploy some docker containers (can be fun and teach you a lot, also offers you some cool selfhosted tools)

4. Mount and unmount some volumes

1orquq3,Tech,cybersecurity,"**Made a Burp extension to stop copy-pasting scan findings manually** Got tired of manually formatting Burp scan results for reports and bug bounty submissions, so I built this extension over the weekend.



What it does:

\- Double-click any finding → full details copied to clipboard (no more manual formatting)

\- Exports to JSON with complete HTTP request/response pairs

\- Generates working curl commands and Python scripts for each vulnerability

\- Tracks which findings you've tested/exploited/marked as false positives (persists across restarts)

\- Shows which findings are unique vs duplicates across hosts

\- Color-coded UI that doesn't hurt your eyes when scrolling through hundreds of findings



The export structure is pretty clean - organized by severity/confidence with stats and ready-to-run test scripts. Works on Windows/Linux/macOS.



It's free and open source (MIT). Been using it for my own pentests and it's saved me a ton of time, figured others might find it useful too.

To your question, there are some essential tools in your toolbox, but these don't need to be anything special. Nmap, dig, nslookup, wireshark, airmon, etc. get you 90 percent of the way. Sure you can modify/build your own, but where most of the customization happens is how you might get the tools to interact, moving output from one to the input of another.

basics of a VPN:  
\- most of the time you set these up only our internet firewall, and it allows users offsite to connect to your business network. Once they are connected there is a secure encrypted ""tunnel"" from their computer to your office network. It's as if they are in the office. They will have access to all the resources you have in your office (servers/files, printers, etc)

It's secure and if done correctly the best, if not one the best ways to allow access remotely. 

one caveat: bad guys are always looking for active VPNs.. they are a wonderful way for bad guys to get in.. then they have access to all the resources your employees do. So employees that use the VPN need very good passwords. The VPN needs to be configured correctly and updated.

nnlgfw7,Tech,cybersecurity,"nan CISSP is basically for middle management.. it's a broad test with very little depth.. it's just about memorizing and dumping on a test. there are better uses of your time. 

Where to start:  
have you spoken to your job about your career path? where do they see you going? what is the time frame? what do you need to do to make that happen? this is where you start. they are going to be honest with you.. they might say ""this is all we have for you"" if thats the case, be professional and get back to work.. and quietly start looking for something new with more career growth opportunities. they might say ""you need to show up on time, your work isnt to the quality we need it to be for you to move up"".. if thats the case step up.. and get where you need to be. they might say ""se see you doing XYZ over the next year, and if you do well we can put you in position A"". just be professional, keep your cool.. and take in what they have to say. 



as far as what to learn and how. if you are a cyber crime analyst.. it seems like you would have quite a bit of flexibility in terms of how you spend your free time at work.. pick up some projects that will help the company or agency that will also help you learn. 

in terms of intelligence gathering: OpenCTI is a good open source project that manages threat data. Learn how to set it up, run it.. manage it.. and how to put useful data into it. Learn to pull useful threat data from the web into it. use that information to write some threat briefs and reports. You can incorporate MISP (another open source project) into it.. or some of the other platforms your company/agency uses. (crowdstrike, alien vault, etc, stix/taxii feeds)

from there you go 100 different routes.   
I'd suggest learning to script/program.   
\- Bash (linux)  
\- Powershell (windows)  
\- python (everything)

nns94ua,Tech,cybersecurity,"nan Around the certification side of things, I agree that they are good for validating knowledge, and proving your own interest to future employers. Whilst nothing beats experience, I've always found certs to always guide me to my next path in security. 

I'm currently an IR manager within the financial sector, however have worked in MSSPs previously and am exposed to most things technical within security in my current role. 

Security+ is a good baseline cert if you haven't had experiences with formal courses previously. I'd recommend at least going through the course material to give you a sense of what else you may find interesting in security (vuln management, pentesting, GRC, DevSecOps, SecOps etc). It won't make you an expert by a long shot, but it will at least give you baseline knowledge and a good right foot for your next step. 

After that you can then start to look into courses or materials that you found interesting from Sec+, such as cloud (CCSP, AZ-XX, AWS certs etc), Pentesting (such as TCM academy,  OSCP), Blue Team (such as Cysa+, CCD etc). The world's your oyster, and there's no shortage of certs to do.

1oqpz2q,Tech,cybersecurity,"I was tired of vendor lock-in and fragmented tools, so I built my own open-source SOC platform. Just made it public. Hey r/cybersecurity,  
  
Like many of you, I've spent years in enterprise security wrestling with a dozen different tools that don't talk to each other, dealing with insane licensing costs, and being completely locked into vendor ecosystems.  
  
I got tired of it.  
  
So, over the last few months, I built the platform I always wished existed: Wildbox.  
  
The idea is simple: a unified, open-source (MIT license), self-hosted Security Operations Center in a box. It integrates the functionality of multiple tools into one cohesive system:  
  
\- SIEM & Log Correlation  
\- Threat Intelligence Aggregation (from 50+ sources)  
\- Vulnerability Management (Guardian)  
\- SOAR & Automated Response (Responder)  
\- Endpoint Monitoring (via osquery)  
\- AI-Powered Analysis (GPT-4 integration)  
  
...and more (11 microservices total).  
  
It's built on a modern stack (FastAPI, Next.js, OpenResty, Docker) and designed to be deployed with a single command (./setup.sh).  
  
I just made the repository public and I'm looking for brutal, honest feedback from real  security professionals. Does this solve a problem you  have? What's missing? What did I get completely wrong?

Called it phantom.net. It is intended to be an isolated, decentralized communications infrastructure network. You can imagine it as a kind of highway. Of course, everything the network communicates or shares, everything is encrypted. 

In addition, it has features such as onion routing, mimicry, dynamic adjustment of packet sizes and other features to camouflage itself in network traffic

It should work in such a way that you need a client to use it. You could run a completely decentralized and absolutely anonymous instant messaging system on this architecture. It's best to run it on a Linux computer or smartphones with Graphenos etc.

1oqiu17,Tech,cybersecurity,"[Showcase] We built an open-source unified vulnerability management platform — ThreatVault (final beta) Hey everyone,

After years of juggling too many dashboards — Nessus here, OpenVAS there, Trivy somewhere, AWS Security Hub screaming in the corner — I finally decided to fix it.

Together with my teammate, we built [**ThreatVault.io**](https://threatvault.io) — an **open-source unified vulnerability management platform** that pulls every finding from *any security tool* into one clean dashboard.

**What it does now:**

* Integrates with Nessus, OpenVAS, Trivy, AWS Security Hub, and more via plugins
* Tracks SLA breaches and remediation timelines
* Lets you onboard teams and assign ownership
* Consolidates SAST, SCA, DAST, SBOMs, and compliance scans
* Everything viewable and filterable in a single place

We’re currently **90% done** and entering **final private beta**.  
We’re looking for real security engineers, DevSecOps folks, or vulnerability managers who want to:

* Try it in real environments
* Break things
* Help shape the final release

Instead of starting a shell and manually setting up variables or aliases, you can describe your setup once and start it with a single command.

Each profile defines:

* Environment variables
* Working directory
* Lifecycle hooks
* Custom prompts
* Which shell or command to run

Run `sbsh -p bash-demo` to launch a fully configured session.  
Sessions can be detached, reattached, listed, and logged, similar to `tmux`, but focused on reproducibility and environment setup.

You can also define profiles that run **Docker** or **Kubernetes** commands directly.

1or9blc,Tech,linux,"minecraft-tui -- release Hello everyone! I am very very happy to finally announce that I published my project: minecraft-tui! 

So, what is it, how does it work, and \_why\_? 

Well, I love TUI apps. I am a linux enjoyer, it just feels so much better in my opinion to use a TUI/CLI app instead of a GUI app. Minecraft-tui is a TUI app that allows you to launch minecraft instances trough a TUI instance. It opens a floating terminal, shows currently available instances, lets you open them, edit the files in them, and see info about them.

  
\_How does it work?\_ Under the hood, its a bash script... I could not, for the life of me, get rust to launch the instance. It would break the entire project when I tried it, and so I just made a script to run the instances. At some point the script will be deprecated, I will try to still make it so that you dont need a bash script for it. But for now, its a ""rough sketch"". You can check the github page to find out more about it, I wont explain it all here because it would be too long.

  
\_Why?\_ As I said before, I love TUI apps. They are cleaner, using a keyboard feels better, and its a fun little project. it is not, by any means, a minecraft launcher. It is just a ""quick opener"" (I wasnt sure what to call it lol). 

  
If you have any issues, let me know on the github page! 

  
PS: I have only tried it on i3-wm!! I will try to test it on other WMs but it will take some time. 

PS2: It only works with Prism Launcher for now!! The whole project is centered about Prism Launcher (installed from flatpak), as I use Linux Mint, and Prism is not in the official repos. In the future I will make it so it will check for the installation, and I hope I will make it work in more scenarios, other than my use case. 

  
Please try it out if you want, enjoy, and let me know if there are any issues, or if you have any ideas on what to change! <3

nnoreax,Tech,linux,"nan Microsoft got its software -- first MSDOS and later Windows -- pre-installed on most PCs throughout the 80s and 90s due to monopolistic business deals (which the US government later sanctioned them for, though by then it was too late).  Once that snowball started rolling, it was hard to stop the momentum.  People aren't likely to want to change something as fundamental as their operating system, even if there are objective benefits.  (Just look at how resistant people tend to be to even switch browsers.)

Linux is technically older than Windows.  The first stable version of Linux was released in 1994, while Windows 95 didn't release until 1995, obviously.  (Versions of Windows prior to Win95 weren't actually operating systems, but graphical desktop environments running on MSDOS.  Though that's a distinction a casual user wouldn't necessarily be aware of, so this gave Windows even more of a head start.)  But for at least the first decade of its existence, Linux wasn't really user-friendly or targeted at casual users.  Setting it up and using it required a level of technical knowledge that Uncle Joe who just wants to be able to check his email and edit a few spreadsheets wouldn't have.  While there were ""mainstream"" distros going back to the mid-90s, it's really only been in the last couple of decades that various distros have put a greater amount of focus on making Linux something that's viable for the general public -- something that Uncle Joe, with his limited technical skills, could install and use on his own.  

Currently, yes, modern Linux is now arguably more user-friendly for casual users than Windows, but Windows had a lot of time to get established as the dominant OS for personal computers.

nnqej3u,Tech,linux,"nan First of all, that's not a dumb question... If it were a dumb question, it will have a complete yet simple answer.

First of all, it's mostly about standards. Linux become the industry standard for unix first, and then become the internet server standard because of its implementations of services such as mail, dns and http server (apache). Then, for development is one of the industry standards because of the availability of software. Reasons? One of them, availability of reliable software.

But for end users? First, lack of availability of industry standard software. Photoshop, Illustrator, Office, Games, and so on... But also ""cheap"" availability on windows: Piracy does it part also...

Let me put this straight with an example: how many people you hear saying that gimp is crap? Lots. How many of them actually have licensed their PS copy or pay a subscription? Very little. Industry does not go THAT far with piracy, because being the industry standard becomes first. ""It's better to have the half of something instead of the whole of nothing"". Industry goes behind those users that are easier to catch: corporate ones, because they pay the bills and they're a mile better to catch. This will be a mile better to see if most of this software were licensed in a way similar to WinRAR: you as a final user just skips the banner and use the software without limitations; but corporate users are those who pay for it. Also, check out how difficult is to catch end users consuming piracy: for Netflix as an example, is a kind of groundhog day in that aspect...

Also, there's a lack of standard in open source for desktop computing. When free software is good enough, sooner or later has the chance to be the standard; and more if it's the first in line. Linux is standard in servers because was first reliable, and then it was free. OBS Studio is industry standard because is good enough to stream screen content when no other reliable solution was available; something similar happened to VLC, or VirtualBox. VSCode turned an industry standard because it was first reliable.

But Linux in desktop is DECADES behind: Both KDE and GNOME are decades around, since the 2000s, but never reached maturity to be reliable. First, KDE looked promising, but the usage of QT, a privative toolkit, to develop it, fired a kind of ""holy war"", splitting efforts, and being the GNOME reason to exist. Linux per se became a standard, because it focalised lots of efforts. FreeBSD and OpenBSD were also there; but Linux focused the needed effort to be a better solution and become the standard. But, it's 2025 and the guys of desktops don't realise that: KDE continues trying to be ""bleeding edge"", and GNOME to mature half way, being bland. Something similar happened to lots of the GNU/FSF software: parts of it became standard when the efforts properly focused.

Nowadays, with Win11 being too restrictive and ""soldering"" IA too deep, there's a sort of opportunity for Linux to gain adoption; but again, the desktop people is way too distracted re-engineering and over-engineering the wheel. PewDiePie gave Linux some momentum, but there's not enough to sustain that traction, sadly.

BTW, my daily driver is a mac mini; but most of the software I run is free/open; being almost the same I use in my laptop running Arch/Omarchy: the only difference is in the window management, because ironically, there's not a good tiling WM in Mac... But sadly, corporate soft like slack, zoom or citrix has no support on Linux. And let me point the last point: support. They are available on Linux; but for corporate use, they tailor installers containing encryption keys, and they make them only for the OSes that client corporations grant/pay for.

Excited to share that Nixopus Extensions are finally here!

Nixopus is your go-to tool for managing your Linux server. Even your grandma can manage your linux server now!

Think of extensions like Docker images. All in a good UI, browse hundreds of self hostable applications, single click install them, and it will be up and running on your linux server in no time!

For example, you can spin up Appwrite, Excalidraw, Ollama, CodeServer, and many more with zero setup hassle.

Here's what Extensions bring:

- 150+ self hostable apps which you can deploy instantly
- Custom domains for your hosted apps
- Live build logs so you can see what's happening as it deploys
- See all your running apps in one place, skip the `docker ps` dance.
- Transparent by design, every extension shows you exactly what it'll run on your linux server. No black boxes, no surprises.
- Customizable extensions so you can tweak things your way
- Full browser based management for deployments
- Supports Debian, Ubuntu, arch, rhel

And here's the best part, you can even package your own app as an extension, as simple as dropping in a single file.

1or04gp,Tech,linux,"We should act before the imminent destruction of the concepts of device ownership I’m sadly starting to see a trend. Most phone bootloaders are locked nowadays. It’s not one specific manufacturer, it’s basically everyone.

If the OEM gives you the option to unlock them, it either voids the warranty or comes with severe punishment.

When you want to root your phone to get the liberty you lost to the “security features”, you basically break any apps that check for play integrity or other methods to detect root (even tho you can bypass that, it’s against TOS). I've mostly seen this on banking apps, but they are not the only ones. Not to mention that to even have the play integrity API, you have to have Google services installed and running. So you can't even de-Google your phone and keep the features.

This problem has been rampant on phones, it’s definitely not new, but it's basically the first thing that blocks the development of Linux for general phones. 

Not to mention that no constructors follow a common thing like UEFI, they just all have their own thing. Which is a real pain for any kind of OS development.

Those aren’t the only issues tho, there's also all the proprietary blobs stuff. Without a way to either replicate them without reverse engineering, or open sourcing versions of the drivers, we will be stuck in this situation. Look at postmarketOS, they struggle a lot with this. This makes adding a device to their supported list a really hard thing to do, while costing a lot of time and money.

I think this will happen soon to laptops and desktops too. With the rise of ARM, I believe locking the bios and bootloader of those systems is not out of the question. Apple already kind of started with IBoot. It’s not fully locked, but definitely less open than what was used before in Intel macs.

And it’s not that ARM devices don't support UEFI, they absolutely do. Most Windows ARM systems use them right now. Arm’s SystemReady program allows them to boot just like x86 PCs do.

**Then why the lockdown?**

They will definitely say it’s for security, but Windows PCs, arm or not, have proven that you can have security while giving the user the choice to disable that security. UEFI and Secure Boot work just fine on ARM too, so it's not even a compatible issue. Secure defaults can be set as default, there is no problem with that. There is a really clear problem when those same defaults can’t be changed tho.

Now they'll probably argue that they didn't choose to do so, and that’s required by regulations.

I believe this is either misinformation, a stretch or a straight-up lie.

Radio and DRM firmware can stay on an isolated part of the device on their own. They don't need to prevent the entire OS boot process. The radio part already runs on an isolated part of the system on its own processor with signed firmware that complies with the FCC/RED requirements. The same thing goes for the DRM issue. User keys can allow for banking apps and all the other apps to verify the system without having to rely on OEM only control.

**We need to act, not just complain**

# What we should ask for:

* We need to ask for owner-managed Secure Boot on every single type of general purpose computer. This goes for phones, smartwatches, computers… you get the point.
* Either allow the user to disable secure boot or allow the user to manage their own keys, with proper documentation on how to do so.

We should also try to separate the concerns:

* The radio and DRM stuff can be kept under signed, secure version on isolated systems to meet regulations.
* This should NOT require a full system lockdown or OEM to have the full control over what you boot on YOUR device.
* Provide documentation on how to interface with the hardware like GPS, Camera, GPUs and all to allow for third party OSes to develop properly without having to reverse engineer every single driver. This also means being able to develop proper alternatives to those NDA-only drivers.

We should have proper control over our device security:

* Devices should be able to support TPM or DICE in a way that allows baking apps, enterprise and DRM to work with third party OSes.
* They should also work with User provided keys.

We need to address the EOL and right to repair situation.

* When OEM updates end, we NEED to have a proper way to continue using the device with third party software, such as postmarketOS. This means allowing the user to unlock or provide keys to continue using the device.
* This would reduce e-waste by extending the device’s life.

We also want to know how our devices work. OEMs should have proper, publicly accessible documentation on the entire boot process and unlock procedure.

**Why should we act now ?**

With ARM growing in popularity, I'm kinda afraid the open boot system we had until now on desktop will disappear too. If OEM lockdown becomes the norm on PCs too, it will be really hard, almost impossible, to reverse those changes. It’s basically our last chance to act.

**How should we act ?**

Well, the EU has some places we can reach and some projects that kinda match what we want. We can associate ourselves with the right to repair movement, and try to prevent the entire ecosystem from being locked down.

So you should contact your MEPs. Explain that all of this is needed for fair competition, sustainability and right to repair.

Also try to reference existing proof of things like this already existing. Reference Windows PCs on ARM with UEFI support, x86 PCS allowing Secure Boot management and all. If you have additional arguments, please give them to other people so we can really argue to our MEPs.

You should state that it should be a right and that it’s not really weakening security, as user keys can do the same thing as OEM keys.

If you are in the states, I don’t know what you can do. So if someone has an idea, please post it.

Btw, English isn’t my native language, so there are going to be mistakes in this text, or repetition due to my lack of vocabulary. This is also my second time posting this. The first time I used AI translation which some people didn’t like. So I translated it all myself, even if some parts are not exactly how I want them to be, you'll probably get the idea. But be aware that my last two grades in English were 6.5/10 and 5.5/10.

Also, I’m not a professional, those are my opinions and I basically gathered as much info as I could to not spread misinformation. I removed some part on IBoot due to people saying I wasn’t quite right in the last post. So if you see anything wrong, please correct me and ill edit the post.

This battle was lost on mobile like 15 years ago. We even had things like Meego

Now we couldn’t even have a third OS and why google is gonna give up control for nothing?

Not that it would matter even if you create third operating system with a free phone - Instagram/Snapchat/Fortnite/etc won’t work on it so who will use it?

1oqsntw,Tech,linux,"Trying Linux desktop again after 15 years Hello everyone, I am not new to Linux at all. Every server I manage runs Debian, and I mostly use Linux through the SSH console. As a desktop operating system, I was using Windows 11 because all my Linux desktop experiences have been terrible compared to Windows. I do not remember exactly why I switched back to Windows 15 years ago, but since then I tried again once, about two years ago, on my brand-new laptop. Unfortunately, an Ubuntu (Debian-based) bug with the lid sensor broke the entire operating system after the first reboot. It was a known bug (someone explained to me that it had been fixed in the latest update), but still, after installing and setting everything up, I had to reinstall the entire system just because I closed my laptop without shutting it down. That was the moment I realized why I had stopped using Linux on my main system 15 years ago. I installed Windows 11 on it and never had any issues since then. Everything worked out of the box, even the touchscreen.

Yesterday I decided to try again. I really like Linux, so I installed Ubuntu once more, this time on my main rig, which I use for gaming and most of my development work. I decided to set up a dual boot with Windows for gaming and Ubuntu for work, social media, and other tasks. After installing everything (BitLocker and Secure Boot were a real pain to deal with), Ubuntu was working fine at first. Then I got a crash error. I sent the report and ignored it. A little later, another crash error appeared. I sent that report too and ignored it, thinking the system update might fix everything.

After setting up both my screens, I started updating the system. Everything seemed to be updating correctly. On the first reboot, Ubuntu stopped working. Both screens showed the terminal boot output and froze there. Great. I found out that the Debian desktop environment had somehow broken. Reinstalling it from the recovery console fixed it, and the system started again. Then I realized I could no longer open folders... Nautilus had simply disappeared or stopped working. I had to reinstall Nautilus, wondering why something so basic would just break and why I was installing such an unstable system.

Now the OS finally seems to work without random crash errors, though a lot of weird stuff is still happening. Resizing the VirtualBox window breaks everything, and every time I install an app from the App Center, I hope it actually launches (half of them do not, and I have to install them manually from the website). Sometimes when I type text, the window freezes for a few seconds, making input lag badly.

I know Windows has its flaws, but everything works there, and I have never had these issues in years across different hardware setups. Maybe the problem is my old SSD dying or something hardware-related, but since Windows works perfectly, I think the issue is more OS-related. I will keep using Ubuntu as my main system for now since everything is installed and working, but I do not trust it. The constant feeling that everything can break so easily is not comfortable for me.

After complaining (I had to, so I decided to write about my experience instead), I can say that when things work, it’s awesome. I’ve found every tool I need, and everything I used on Windows is available on Linux. I honestly don’t feel like I need anything from Windows anymore... except for gaming. I hope I was just unlucky this time and that everything will keep working without breaking again. My experience really shows me why many people don’t like using Linux.

nnr049y,Tech,linux,"nan I just reinstalled Windows (for dual-boot), and I didn’t have to install *anything.*.. not even drivers. Even the NVIDIA drivers and Control Panel were already installed out of the box. Have you ever actually tried installing Windows before writing all this?

This is exactly why Linux will never become a widely used OS: the Linux community seems convinced it’s acceptable to encounter issues during installation or daily use. Just read the comments below... apparently, it’s *my fault* because I have “problem-solving issues.” What? That’s hilarious.

On the other hand, Windows just works. Linux will never truly compete with Windows not because it’s a bad OS, but because of the *mindset* of its community. It feels like people are constantly looking for excuses, blaming users instead of the OS. If a distro crashes, it’s the user’s fault. If someone can’t fix it through the terminal, it’s the user’s fault again.

Then come all the false claims, like yours, about Windows having just as many issues. But you probably haven’t used Windows in the last 10 years and simply assume that problems are “normal” in an OS. They’re not. I have four different devices running Windows, and everything works perfectly on all of them: fingerprint scanners, touchscreens, even old TV/FM receivers...  all functional right out of the box.

At the end of the day, the truth is simple:  
Is Linux a cool OS? Absolutely. After fixing several issues, I’m even using it as my main system now. I can finally ditch Windows since Linux now offers comparable functionality. I even managed to play some Steam games directly from my external Windows HDD, which is awesome.

But will Linux ever be a true competitor to Windows for home users? Definitely not. And I’m starting to believe the problem isn’t the OS itself... it’s the community’s mentality.

nnlfbc8,Tech,linux,"nan Debian-based is generally the issue, especially depending on use case. It's great for servers, but for the desktop because of the slow updates (even Ubuntu only offers updates every 6 months) it can run into snags. Definitely did for me.

Debian can be fine depending on use case. But since I do a wide range of things on the desktop, a big part of that being gaming and multimedia uses, it just runs into too many issues.

For example, when playing games you want to be on the latest graphics drivers, especially with Nvidia (which is what I use.) A rolling distro keeps you on the latest driver. Like, in Windows I wouldn't expect people to use a GPU driver that's 6 months to 2 years old and not run into problems. To a lesser extent the same goes for things like audio, peripherals, etc.

The Linux desktop has also advanced really fast over the past year due to Wayland development picking up. A lot of time when I ran into a problem it was already fixed just not in the LTS releases, and wouldn't be for some time. Also Canonical likes to use their interim releases as a beta testing ground. Which is why I'd still recommend plain Debian if it comes to that.

Ubuntu was big 15 years ago when it was pretty much *the* friendly Linux distribution. All others have caught up, and in some cases surpassed Ubuntu when it comes to user-friendliness.

Does all this still cause problems for new users because of the confusing distro landscape and people recommending distros before asking what the computer is or what it will be used for? Very much yes, it is a big problem IMO.

I was willing to tough it out. The vast majority of the people won't.

I still wince when someone asks, ""I have a new computer, what distro should I install?"" and people immediately recommend Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, etc. I'm pretty experienced, and I still ran into problems with those that were, by design, unfixable until maybe the next major release.

1oqapvo,Tech,linux,"Proposal for People who wants Menus in LibAdwaita apps Hi folks, 

Long time linux user here, and a mobile app developer thinking of solving my own issue with lack of Global Menus.

I noticed that many apps (especially Gnome apps with LibAdwaita) doesn't come with Global Menu support.

For people who work the most in Graphics management, or Video Editing or 3D modelling needs menus completely or for anyone like me who just loves Global Menus, Gnome apps feel very watered down.

However, they do look so pretty compared to Qt apps in the KDE world. Btw I'm using KDE currently, and yes I'm aware of ricing. This is more about choice, what if someone like me loves the UI design of LibAdwaita more than Kirigami?

I'm thinking of an idea:

Even though Gnome apps doesn't have menus, they still have keyboard shortcuts. What if, just like we have .desktop files describing icons, we have a .menu files describing menus where they weren't advertised?

These can just be user defined (or crowd sourced and vetted in a git repository) which just simulates a keyboard shortcut?

A custom extension will then add this to the panel and render. Thoughts?

**The why**

I knew the end of win10 support was looming, and I was less than excited about the prospect of moving to win11. The removal of features previous versions of Windows had, and the addition features I did not want, the lower performance in games compared to win10, the horror stories of breaking updates, had me holding off the move for as long as I could. The gradual but consistent removal of user agency already had me frustrated on win10, and it only seemed to get worse with 11.

""Do you want to update and restart? Your options are Yes, and Yes, but later. Do you want me to ask again? Just kidding, I will anyways. Unless of course I notice your PC idling for an extended period of time, in which case I'll just do it without asking."" Great.

""Oh you want to install the OS without logging into our servers? Nooo, no, I can't let you do that. Oh you're doing the little rain dance ritual in the terminal? Allright. Just this once. Oh now you want to have a vertical task bar? Lol. Lmao even. Not on my watch. Now get back to work on those documents I helpfully uploaded to my cloud servers for you."" Ugh.

Then MS Recall hit the news. That one was a bit too much even for me, but at least I didn't need to care until I upgraded, right? Well, one article mentioned a command to check the service state. I punched it into the console for fun and.... ""Feature Name: Recall. State: Enabled."" Wait. What? On Windows 10? I didn't see anything? I went snooping around the system files, and there was only a skeleton folder with nothing functional in it, but in my mind that clearly meant they were preparing for something. Now a year later, it still hasn't manifested, so maybe it was just an accidental inclusion, who knows. Either way, that was the last straw for me.

**The what**

So. Now what. Apple was a contender, but the lack of user agency and vendor lock-in stays the same, barely any gaming is possible as far as I know, in addition to the rather high upfront cost for the hardware, and my desktop was barely a year old at that point, so that was out of the question. I don't hate on Apple, don't get me wrong, it's good hardware and their OS does many things right, it's just not ideal for the cheapskate tinkerer and gamer in me.

I was aware Linux existed though, from having rescued my win98 data from a broken drive using KNOPPIX over a decade ago. I also played around with Ubuntu on my Raspberry PI and ran a webserver for a while, so I knew how to ""apt update && apt upgrade"" and even ""reboot"", but that was pretty much the extent of my knowledge.

So I figured, If I'm going to do this, I'll have to start from the ground up with something easy, and I'll do it in a virtual machine, just to make sure I can handle it and see how I like it. Not knowing much about distros at that point, I just made sure to choose one from the debian family to keep the familiar package manager, and went with the one I saw recommended a lot- Linux Mint. So I spun up a VMWare VM, and for about two months, I booted into Windows, then immediately opened the VM and fullscreened it, and then just went about my daily business from there.

And that phase was surprisingly frictionless. The updates went through the familiar apt without a hitch. Installing Discord and Cinny went fine. Thunderbird synced mails from all my providers with ease. Brainrotting on Youtube worked just fine too. I did install Steam and tried gaming, but lacking proper GPU passthrough, that wasn't exactly a smooth experience. The games I tested did start though, so that was a good sign for the bare metal install.

So instead I spent some time just getting comfortable with the system, installing software, replacing parts of the system, breaking things and trying to fix them. I got rid of Cinnamon and installed Plasma for its customizability and just binged on all the themes and funny cursors I could find. And that was unfortunately the point where I learned the price you pay for stability. At that time, I was reading news about the release of Plasma 6, with all the fancy features I *needed*, but all I could get from the repos was 5.27. Welp.

I love Mint. It has a special place in my heart now. I cannot stress enough how much I love the devs. Their default answer to any question I looked up seemed to be ""Our professional opinion is that you shouldn't, but if you still want to, here's how."" The level of respect you feel as a user is just something you don't get on Windows, or even many other distros. I still maintain one doesn't choose Mint over Ubuntu for any technical differences, but because of the amazing developers.

Anyways, at that point I have lurked enough on the subreddits and watched enough Linux Youtube to know about rolling release distros, and to have seen the Arch memes. I guess it wouldn't hurt to check it out. ""Rolling releases..."" Yep. ""...targeted at the proficient GNU/Linux user, or anyone with a do-it-yourself attitude who is willing to read the documentation..."" Okay, that's fine. ""...a pragmatic distribution rather than an ideological one [...] Evidence-based technical analysis and debate are what matter, not politics or popular opinion. "" You know what, I love that. Add new VM.

It took hours of reading the installation guide, but actually, the installation difficulty was not as high as expected. Download the iso, format the drive, set locale, create a user, install the packages. Same steps as Mint, just without a GUI. Add Plasma on top, and it largely feels the same as my beloved Mint. But now everything is more up to date. Yeah I can do this. Time for the bare metal install.

**The move**

Exactly one year ago, I unplugged my Windows drive just to be sure. Picked an older SSD out of storage and plugged that in instead. Still wanted to keep my Windows drive, just in case. I copy pasted all commands I used in the VM into a text file and sent that to my phone, so the second time around very little reading was needed. The installation time dropped from hours to minutes. Pretty sure that was less work than clicking through a GUI installer. Kinda starting to enjoy this terminal thing.

With the install finished, I plug my Windows drive back in, set up my boot order to prefer Linux, and boot into my fresh system. Everything seems fine except... My mainboard and RAM are lit up like a christmas tree. The RGB versions were on sale and cheaper than the blacked out components, but the software I used on Windows to disable them doesn't exist on Linux. Ah. Didn't consider that.

Quick search later I learn about OpenRGB. Long search later and some help from the OpenRGB Discord, I learn that my RAM brand needs a specific kernel module blacklisted to work with OpenRGB, whatever that means. It does work though, and using the HardwareSync plugin, I can even mirror my Windows setup and have my RAM light up when my CPU reaches critical temperatures. Brilliant!

Next on the order of business, the horizontal scroll wheel on my Logitech mouse doesn't control the volume anymore. I tested this in the VM, I guess it was just properly passed through. On Linux, Logitech software doesn't exist, but Solaar does. Highjack the wheel, bind ""XF86_AudioRaiseVolume"" and ""XF86_AudioLowerVolume""  to ""up"" and ""down"" respectively et voila! Neat.

Next. My external drives aren't recognized. Quick rummage through the Arch wiki, and an install of ntfs-3g later, that issue is gone too. Everything else? Just... Works? Wifi works, GPU works, gamepad works, Euro Truck Sim Works, Flight Sim works, Stardew Valley and OpenTTD too. Don't really need much more. I could get used to this.

**The Bash excursion**

I used the terminal quite a bit to solve the arising issues by now, so at this point I wasn't afraid of it anymore and excited to explore it. Reading guides, looking at cheat sheets, watching ""Top 100 console commands on Linux you NEED to know! You won't believe #69!"" is great fun and I start to pick up nice qol tips here and there. ""sudo !!"" reruns the previous command with elevated privileges without the need to retype the whole thing. ""!<number from history>"" reruns the given command. ""\^old\^new"" reruns the previous command with the given part replaced. The time savings!

Learning about .bashrc was great fun too. I spend hours googling other people's files and set up one letter aliases for my most used commands. I can even have if statements, so I can do things like this, and not even have to think about which of my systems I'm on currently:

    if [ -f /etc/arch-release ]; then
        # Arch
        alias u='sudo pacman -Syu'
        alias i='sudo pacman -S '
        alias f='pacman -Ss '
        alias r='sudo pacman -R '
        alias rr='sudo pacman -Rs '
        alias rrr='sudo pacman -Rns '
        alias c='sudo pacman -Sc'
    elif [ -f /etc/lsb-release ]; then
        # Debian
        alias u='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade'
        alias i='sudo apt install '
        alias f='apt search '
        alias r='sudo apt remove '
        alias rr='sudo apt purge '
        alias c='sudo apt autoremove && sudo apt clean'
    else
        echo ""Unsupported distribution or cannot detect distribution.""
    fi

Functions work too. A quick one-liner to cd into a directory and list the contents immediately makes the whole thing feel more modern. Why isn't this a default? Whatever, the ability to just add that myself gives me a small taste of the potential power.

    cd() {
        builtin cd ""$@"" && ls -AF
    }

And while we're at it, why do I need to type out ""cd ~/.config/fastfetch/"" every time I want to go there? Zoxide exists, sure, but that requires precaching, and if I usually only visit a config directory once after installing the package, what even is the point? But Google tells me fzf and fd exist, and a bit of copy pasting snippets from stackoverflow later, I can just ""fz config fastfetch"" at a barely noticeable performance penalty. Now we're talking.

    fz() {
      local dir
      dir=$(fd --type d --hidden \
               --exclude '.git' \
               --exclude 'node_modules' \
               --exclude '.cache' \
               --exclude '/mnt' \
               --exclude '/run' \
               --exclude '/proc' \
               --exclude '/sys' \
               --exclude '/dev' \
               . / 2>/dev/null \
        | awk '{ print length, $0 }' | sort -n | cut -d' ' -f2- \
        | fzf --query=""$*"" --select-1 --exit-0 \
              --extended-exact --no-sort --height 40% --reverse \
              --preview 'tree -C {} | head -n 20') \
        && cd ""$dir""
    }

Being able to just change the behavior of the shell like that is amazing and makes it feel much more like ""home"". At this point I wanted to write a bit more than just snippets, and having dabbled in game development before, I decided to take what I know and apply it in bash, adding [a leveling system](https://github.com/Divinux/linux-terminal-gamifier) from RPGs to my terminal. It tracks used commands and gives out experience points for using the terminal, and displays fun little messages on level ups, to make using the computer just a little bit more fun. I'll have you know, I'm a lvl 50 currently.

**The unhealthy obsession**

Now, this is the part I'm not proud of. I've come to love Arch. It's philosophy speaks to me and I can't imagine there is a distro that is a better fit for me. But what if... What if there is one and I just don't know it? And anyways, what IS the difference between distros other than the release schedule? How much do the installations actually differ? I've seen the GUI install, I've seen the CLI equivalent, is there something else? And how do the footprints compare, is there anything more lightweight than Arch? Something more challenging? I don't really want to distrohop, but I *do* have VMs at my disposal. I've heard some big names, Fedora exists, openSUSE exists, and there's fancy gaming focused Bazzite and Garuda too! I'll just quickly install those and have a look around, that can't hurt, right?

I spin up a couple VMs and install the big ones, check out the preinstalled packages, the package managers, install fastfetch and take a screenshot of the package versions and footprints. A dozen VMs later, I have a neat looking little folder with fastfetch screenshots, I compare the ASCII art and plot the package amount and memory footprint in a spreadsheet. I look into increasingly more obscure distros to add to my little digital stamp collection. Instead of gaming after work, I spend my time installing new distros. At some point I start going down the list of ASCII logos in the fastfetch source code to see which ones I'm missing.

Most blur together, it's always the Calamares or Anaconda installer. The CLI based ones are largely the same as Arch. Notable differences are the minimalistic source based ones like KISS and CRUX. SourceMage is fun. RedStar is exciting just because of what it is. I didn't find many differences from the surface level looks I gave the distros, but I certainly gained more confidence in my installation and rescue abilities from the more manual ones. Anyways, my collection currently contains 141 OSes. Let this be a warning to you and don't do distrohoping, kids.

**The conclusion**

So, a year after I switched my daily driver to Linux, how do I feel about it? I truly, genuinely, love it. I can do most anything I could with Windows, save for Photoshop and Office365, but whatever, there's alternatives for those. But I can also do *more*. Tinkering with Plasma and making it look and behave how I want is amazing. If you want to do something, theres a setting for it. My UI themes are perfectly synchronized between Qt and GTK, my icon theme is a custom monochrome version of candy icons, because if you want to write a script to run through all the svg files and pull all the color out, you can. My mouse cursor seems pretty vanilla, but is also a custom converted version originally only available on Windows, because if you want to convert that, you can do that too.

My terminal is set it up with tmux first and later replaced that with WezTerm to give me persistent sessions as well as graphics support. It still greets me with the same weather report styled through figlet that I set up on my first day of playing with it, but now it also pulls the Arch rss feed to alert me of any potential update issues. All in a custom colorscheme of course.

Everything, from the messages shown during boot, to the installed packages, to the behavior of windows, down to the colors of every last pixel is - to quote Kanye from before he went mad - ""the exact motherfucker I wanted"". And more importantly, it doesn't stand in my way when I need to do some actual work.

Yes, perfect doesn't exist, and sometimes there is something to fix. But annoyances exist on Windows too that require investing time, using google, troubleshooting and typing commands into the scary console. The difference however is this- on Windows, I'm always undoing things the developers did, while on Linux, I'm fixing things the (volunteer) developers for whatever reason didn't have the capacity for. On Windows, I'm fighting *against* the developers, and on Linux, I'm fighting *alongside* them.

And that is why I feel it's important to get more newbies into the ecosystem, more eyes on bugs, more people to complain, and more potential developers who think ""fuck it, I'll just do it myself"". And I'll certainly be here to welcome them with open arms.

more importantly it doesnt stand in my way when i need to do some actual work yes perfect doesnt exist and sometimes there is something to fix but annoyances exist on windows too that require investing time using google troubleshooting and typing commands into the scary console the difference however is this on windows im always undoing things the developers did while on linux im fixing things the volunteer developers for whatever reason didnt have the capacity for on windows im fighting against the developers and on linux im fighting alongside them and that is why i feel its

1opx1ie,Tech,linux,"Status of linux tablets in 2025 I did a lot of research into this and finally found that Surface Go 2/3/4 are pretty much the only devices that qualifies as true x86 linux ""tablets"" out there, which is a bit disappointing, since they are a bit underpowered and top out at 8 GB of RAM.

Other options are too heavy and are awkward to use as tablets. Examples are Surface Pro models, Minisforum v3, Starlite and Surface-like devices from Dell (latitude 7210 for example), HP and Lenovo.

IMO they better quality as compact laptops rather than tablets.

Surface Go devices are around 500+ grams (1.20 lbs) and are comfortable to hold and use as tablets. 

They are 100% compatible with linux out of the box.

1opwbd3,Tech,linux,"We need Linux pre-installed at Big box store PCs and an advertising campaign One big reason Linux still struggles to gain ground on desktop PCs comes down to simple reality. Most people never install their own operating system. The average user just sticks with whatever came on their new PC, and doesn’t think about changing it until they buy a new one. That’s not something we can blame them for, it’s just how the consumer market works.

Imagine walking into Costco, BJs, or Walmart and actually seeing Linux PCs sitting right next to Windows machines, ready to buy, pre-installed, fully supported. Pair that with a marketing push that says things like, “Use a PC that doesn’t bombard you with ads!” or “No AI spying on your every move!” and you’ve got something that speaks directly to growing privacy concerns and respect for the user. This is what we need. Something closer to how Apple markets their systems and OS.

Imagine a SuperBowl ad (or similar effort in other than the US) about how Linux respects the user and doesn't shove ""AI Slop"" on the desktop and the buzz that might create.

The next step is making support accessible, real humans who know Linux, ready to help new users. That combination, visibility, message, and support, is how Linux moves from being a niche choice to a mainstream one.

Macs hold a decent share of the desktop market not just because macOS is user friendly, but because Apple stands behind it. They control the full experience, the hardware, the software, and the support. When something goes wrong, users know exactly where to go. Meanwhile, no major PC manufacturer has taken that kind of ownership with Linux, mostly because doing so would risk upsetting Microsoft, the source of much of their revenue from Windows licensing. Yes, we have smaller vendors who will do this, but we need larger players to place Linux AHEAD of Windows as the preferred OS. I don't see this happening but its a problem.

Flatseal helps with that, but should you really need a separate piece of software outside your desktop environment to manage permissions? Ehh..I don’t think so.

nnafg13,Tech,linux,"nan I’ve never been on board with Snaps or Flatpaks, mostly because they try to solve too many problems at once.

Dependency bundling is fine. If you want an app to ship with its own libs and not depend on whatever the host distro happens to provide, then bundle them. That’s not weird. Windows and macOS apps have dragged their own DLLs/frameworks around for decades; CLI tools too. Totally fine, though it can risk being a little DLL hellish but its worked reasonably well in practice.

Where it goes sideways for me is when bundling gets fused with sandboxing. Sandboxing makes a lot of sense on phones. On desktops it often feels unnecessary and adds overhead and sharp edges. We’ve all seen the messes with Steam, OBS, and friends not behaving in Flatpak/Snap land. Sure, most of that has been papered over, but it’s still extra complexity for marginal benefit in a lot of desktop use cases.

macOS solved this a different way: apps are just .app bundles with their dependencies inside, and the OS layers permissions into the system APIs (TCC/entitlements). You get a consistent permissions model without containerizing the filesystem or inventing a new packaging universe. They’re just folders plus protected APIs.

1op87g3,Tech,linux,"An appreciation post Wednesday, 05/11/25 16:04:50



I use Linux on both my PC and my laptop. I love Linux. I was an early adopter in the form of Red Hat 6.1 -> Mandrake -> SuSE -> Ubuntu around 25 years ago. I stuck with Linux up until my PC died and with limited funds I could buy a ""gaming"" PC from eBay for \~£450.



The specs on the new machine were, on paper, 'okay', not great but certainly okay. The only bottle neck was the CPU. Now, my demands are not great. World of Warcraft is the heaviest lifting any of my machines do and this eBay bargain played it just fine. FPS in major cities on retail is a bit dismal and in heavy raid scenarios things can get dire. But, I am a simple WoW player. I like questing; I like levelling professions; I like making money on the Auction House. In other words, my focus is not on heavy demanding end-game scenarios.



Then, around 18 months ago I started getting the occasional blue screen and lock ups.



When I bought the machine, I was told that, if I press F11 on start up, I would be able to reinstall Windows. It didn't work. So I was stuck with a PC that was becoming more and more unusable as the weeks passed and I didn't (don't) have the money to either buy a licence or replace it.



I always knew Linux was an option but now it was becoming a necessity. The last distro I used was Ubuntu so that was my first port of call. However, I remembered preferring KDE over GNOME, and I knew of Kubuntu. So, I downloaded 24.04 not long after release, used Balena Etcher in Windows to create the USB stick and said goodbye to Windows one last time.



I was up and running in no time and since then my usage has been an absolute joy.



As I have said, my demands are not great. In many ways I am an every day user; the apps I have on my taskbar are Brave, Thunderbird, WoW, Shortwave (radio app), Spotify, Only Office, RedNoteBook (journal), PokerStars, Kate, Konsole and Geany.



Not long after, I found out my daughter hadn't been using a 2014 MacBook Air I had bought her because it had aged and with MacOS it had become unusable. I asked her if I could have it, she said 'sure' and I brought it downstairs. i5 CPU, 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD.  Instinctively, I knew Xubuntu - Ubuntu's XFCE variant - would be a good match.



Within an hour I had a perfectly usable laptop by my side. While I play WoW or poker on my desktop, I'll be watching a stream on the laptop. I also prefer it for social media and I keep my personal journal on it too.



So, now, I have a 9 year old PC and an 11 year old MacBook as my set up. I would dearly love a new computer but, being the eternal pauper, that simply isn't possible.

nn5rwno,Tech,linux,"nan There's a whole webpage about why snap sucks somewhere, just a sec...  basically some sysadmins hate Snap devs for breaking best practices and being arrogant enough to try to define security practices when the sysadmins actually understand the real world issues far better.

Quoted below:

>Why Ubuntu's Snaps are a failure as of 2024-05

>\[NOTE: Frustration expressed. If Snap devs have solved these problems, hooray, you should still have to read how you made thousands or more people feel in the meantime for not doing the obvious\]

>This has been an underlying problem in the Snap mindset for years now, going against Unix and Linux standard practice the entire time. Snap staff does not appear to understand what happens in large-scale environments, and instead is restricting it to the small. To Wit:

>Home directories can be ANYWHERE, not just in the non-standard /home

>There are potentially hundreds of mount points that can contain home directories

>The mount points cannot be predicted to the level just above $HOME in automounts

>It is essential to be able to trust multiple levels down from a given base directory

>Example: Many sites have automount maps that allow home directories resident on users’ workstation to be visible site wide through automounting. The (LDAP) password entries have home directories similar to /nfs/somehostnick/some/path/name/username - and this is just a simple case, I’m not even going to go into the Andrew File System and its worldwide pathnames, where again, home directories can look entirely arbitrary other than that base directory referring to some service. Also, these sites have been around forever (in some cases) and can’t change themselves to fit some developer’s pet mission to “secure” home paths by scaling them down to his/her personal perception of what constitutes reasonable.

>So, now people are going to jump in and so, “Oh, just make /home and automap for everyone’s home directories instead of them been scattered everywhere!” - which makes sense, except that it rarely works well above a few thousand users, because there’s a lot of lag around fetching inode information (ACROSS THE PLANET FOR AFS!) or from hosts that are down, or when some reasonable person has decided to run a script to iterate through all known homes to look at dotfiles or something. It takes multiple minutes to make a long listing of /home/ at many sites trying to make the /home “standard” (which it isn’t) work.

>So for anything thinking the Snap home directory model as it stands (dare I hope for “stood”?), will EVER work in the real world, you are wrong, developers included.

>Snap home directory trust needs to have ways to do the following: Trust anything claimed to be a home directory through password entry (including LDAP) Trust anything under an abitrary prefix (like the /nfs and /afs random examples) Trust anything at all, if the admins want to set the above prefix to “/” If a trusted path uses symlinks, or odd mounts, Snap needs to trust the directory reached If snap fails to support these cases, then snap has failed, period.

Yes and no. 

Linux on ARM is pretty solid on the software side. In terms of applications and open source software most everything is on par with what you get from Linux on the PC. 

The problem is hardware support. 

Unlike PC there isn't really any one standard on how the hardware is initialized and such things. Microsoft does a lot of work making sure things are standardized. Also PC hardware has a lot of sophisticated firmware that helps ensure compatibility. 

On ARM it is the job of the 'bootloader' to do that.  The 'bootloader' does the same functionality of POST and BIOS or UEFI to initialize and setup the hardware. It needs to be programmed to turn on storage devices, to detect and initialize memory, set the functionality of pins on the CPU, etc. 

So the bootloader is the 'firmware' that gets the hardware going. Which is unlike PC were bootloader is just the final stage that helps load the Linux kernel and initrd and executes them. 

On newer and more powerful ARM devices they have UEFI firmware to make them more PC-like.  There are also open source UEFI implementations like EDK2 and GNU-EFI that allow you to boot generic Linux images like you would on the PC.  

But for these low-end devices... it is pretty much wild west. 

The open bootloader typically used is U-Boot, but there are plenty of proprietary and device specific things out there. 

And remember without the bootloader you can't even turn on the device.  Some devices you might need to use JTAG to replace or install bootloaders. 

Usually it is a good idea to have a TTL USB adapter for serial displays. That way if you run into a problem you can see the output over serial because it won't show anything on the normal display output unless everything is pretty much already working. 

It really comes down to device specifics. 

Then there needs to be a Linux devicetree that documents for the kernel where to find and initialize the hardware. 

Most of these android devices use a hacked up Linux kernel that is stuck on a ancient LTS or Android version of the kernel. Getting them working on a vanilla upstream Linux kernel without driver development isn't going to be likely.

----------------------------

So if you are familiar with compiling Linux kernels and modifying C code and such things it is usually possible to get them working.  Most SoC used in these devices are reasonably well documented and have working examples out there. So it is often a task of deep diving into the device specifics and modifying existing code to get working bootloaders and such things. 

They are cheap and rewarding to hack on and the same techniques for hacking on them can also be used to do custom stuff on PC hardware.  Just with much less expense. 

The amount of electricity a lot of these devices need is in like the 10 or 20 watt range. And that is at full blast. The energy usage is less then that at idle. 

So leaving them permanently on is no big deal. Like pennies per month. Makes them useful for home automation and monitoring and other things. 

--------------------------------

Also if RISC-V is interesting to you the same sort of hardware hacking is used for them.  Same things apply.

Although, somewhat ironically given how long they have existed, they are actually a bit better supported. 

-------------------------------

The easiest way to get started in ARM land is to head out to Armbian and look at their ""Platinum"" supported devices.

https://www.armbian.com/download/?device_support=Platinum%20support&arch=aarch64

After using Windows and Ubuntu on WSL under Windows for several years, I decided to go all in on Linux a few months ago. I bought a Framework Laptop 13 with the latest Ryzen 5 AI 340 chipset and installed Ubuntu 25.04 on it. Since this chipset is very new, Ubuntu is not yet ""officially"" supported, and I therefore expected some bumps on the way. But it was very smooth! A tiny hiccup on the WiFi configuration, but overall it went great.

Since Ubuntu is getting more and more snaps, and they seem to deviate more and more from ""pure"" Linux, I decided that I wanted to try out Debian - the ""original"" distro from which so many others are derived. I have never used Debian before, and all the talk about how slow they are supporting new hardware etc. has held me back.

A couple of days ago, I backed up my files and did a clean install of Debian 13 Trixie. The installer ran without any issues whatsoever, and after less than an hour I was up & running. The system could, however, not suspend due to an issue with the WiFi driver refusing to take a nap. This was probably due to Trixie using the 6.12 kernel vs. 6.14 in Ubuntu 25.04. I solved that problem by adding the backports repo and installing the 6.16 kernel from there. No problem! Other than that, I had to figure out how to add my self to the sudoers file, and how to install a few Gnome extensions and tweak it to my liking.

For most of my desktop files, that is things like ~/Music, ~/Documents, etc. That is synced between my desktops using syncthing. I use syncthing for my notes and a few other things. 

Syncthing is peer to peer and doesn't require a server, but I do have a ""server"" with a syncthing instance on it that acts as my main ""hub"". From there I do things like back it up.  

Since the shares are sync'd continuously then if they are deleted off of one system they are deleted off all of them. So backups are needed. Syncthing does have versioning support, but I don't use it. 

For software projects I use git. I use a self hosted Gitea for that (switching stuff over to forgejo a bit at a time).

For dotfiles I edit and care about I use yadm, but there are a billion dot file management software out there that are good. Yadm supports ""alts"" so that I can have alternative dotfiles based on host name or architecture or whatever.

1onik08,Tech,linux,"My Linux History Just wanted to share my experience with Linux over the years.

It started many years ago. My father got a free computer from a friend of his that seen better days. It came in a Compaq case with a 40gb HHD and Windows 2000. Mind you, this was back when Windows XP was on the market. It did work and with a PCI WiFi card, an antenna extender and some aluminum foil, we were able to pick up the unlocked wifi from the Church down the street on days when the weather was good or at night. It was great being able to log into MySpace or play Runescape from home instead at a friend's or library. Then, one day, it started to act weird. Wasn't loading pages or opening the browser or really anything. We soon discovered we had a virus. Not sure at the time how we got it, but it was a problem. 

My father spoke to his ""tech"" friend that he got the computer from and he gave us a copy of Windows XP Home and a few other parts computers. My father and I spent the next few days hodge podging a computer together and installing XP. It ran well for a few weeks until the same thing happened. It began to run slow and do the same things as Windows 2000. We hit a wall again. Did a reinstall of XP and about the same amount of time later, got another virus. It was frustrating. 

While I was at school, a teacher told me about Ubuntu and how it was free and nearly virus proof. Told my father about it and we went to Canonical's site to order a free copy of Ubuntu 7.04 and let me tell you, it was a change. It did just work with our hardware and ran so much faster than Windows ever did. Took a week or so to adapt to the new ecosystem. We stayed with Ubuntu for years after that. I however, eventually got my own laptop and wanted to game. Windows just ran my games so well and didn't give me much trouble. Ubuntu using Wine just would not cut it for nearly any of the games I wanted to play. I drifted from Tux's warm embrace. 

Fast forward to May of 2024. I read about Windows 10 inching towards EOL and having tried 11 on several different machines and not liking it, I decided to see if Linux got any better. After hearing about Proton and the Steam Deck I had high hopes. Asked around online and I was suggested to give Linux Mint a try. Slapped in a new M.2 in my rig and gave a clean install to Mint. Setup was easier than I remembered it being and nearly all my games ran without a hitch. Before long, I didn't even think about Windows. I did get the itch to try out other distros and tried out Debian next. Ran as well as you would expect. Perfectly stable but I was missing some of the touches that the Mint team did. Asked around and was told to try Fedora, Arch and a few others. Took on the challenge and did Arch next. Read the wiki and installed it within an hour or so. Used it for a month and realized it wasn't for me. Aside from updates breaking things here and there, most problems I faced, someone else already has and solved and posted on the Arch fourms or it was on the wiki. Wasn't as hard as others made it out to be. Couldn't figure out why people gloat about using it other than the meme. Grew bored of it and tried out Fedora next. This system was a bit more unique than I expected. Seemed very limited with features and Gnome was annoying to use. If I was on a laptop, I might enjoy it but on a desktop, not so much. Gave the KDE spin a try and found it to be a lot better. Fedora updates seem to break the system far more often than Arch. Well, rather the fixes for the problems took longer to rollout. I went a different direction and gave Ubuntu a try since I knew my parents used it still and found it to be like Mint but with mistake known as Snaps and Gnome. Went back to Mint for another few months when I heard about Linux From Scratch. Was told that was what Arch users pretend they did when they installed Arch. So, I looked into it, did a ton of research and went head first into it. Failed closes to thirty times before I managed to make it happen. I was running an LTS kernel with x11 to make sure things worked. Used the Cinnamon desktop since I liked how basic, yet feature rich it was. I did it, I achieved something that I never thought I would. Problem was it took a lot to upkeep my distro. I was pretty much alone when it came to bugs and issues. Grew tied of it so I defaulted back to Linux Mint. Where it just works and can do anything any other distro can. 

As a note, my father definitely was the source of the viruses we got on our home computer. He admitted it to me years later. 

Also, to get ahead of any ""Wayland is better than x11"" comments, I know x11 is old and Wayland will replace it eventually. I just had way more trouble out of Wayland than I ever have out of x11. Not saying x11 is better, just wanted to have something work more so than to have to fix or configure to do basic functions that x11 already supports and has for years.

Im open to other suggestions to other distros if you all have any.

You'll need **Rich** and **Bleak** in your python environment, but other than that it should be good to go. Then its as simple as `python main.py`. If you still have use of the raw data, you can get it by just adding a filepath/filename at the end of that command, as I didn't change how that outputs at all.

I've only tested with my Max, but with any other Airpods it should output Left, Right, and Case in table format. I did need some assistance from AI because I'm still a novice with Python (I am learning), but some of it was done by me. I spent hours messing with it myself, looking up BleakScanner documents, etc, but had to give up and get help.

The trick with the Airpods Max was that it would read the right ear as the battery when not charging and the left ear as the battery when charging. I solved this by having the script output only the highest battery of the left and right ears and making it so the Max only have one output instead of three.

**Faglo and Delphiki are the original authors. Faglo created AirStatus and, when it no longer worked, Delphiki fixed and created the popular fork which I then edited. They are properly credited at the top of the readme.md.**

1onc1dz,Tech,linux,"[OC] I was frustrated with the lack of good Rclone GUIs, so I built my own: RClone Manager (Tauri + Rust) Hey r/linux!

When I switched to Linux full-time a few years ago, one of the biggest challenges I faced was easily accessing my cloud storage services (Google Drive, OneDrive, Yandex Disk, etc.). I quickly discovered the incredibly powerful CLI tool, `rclone`.

However, constantly writing commands in the terminal or trying to automate everything with `systemd` services (I even [wrote a script for it](https://github.com/Hakanbaban53/Useful-Scripts/tree/main/rclone-systemd)) became tiresome after a while.

When I looked for existing Rclone UIs, I found that most of them were either unmaintained, didn't offer the modern features I was looking for, or were simply buggy.

So, to scratch my own itch, I started developing my own open-source project: **RClone Manager**.

# What is RClone Manager?

RClone Manager is a GUI that brings the full power of `rclone` into a fast, modern desktop application, built using **Tauri (Rust)** and **Angular (TypeScript)**. My goal is to enable even new Linux users to manage their cloud storage accounts without needing to touch the terminal.

The project is fully open-source under the **GPLv3+** license.

# 🎯 Key Features:

Here's what you can do with the current version:

* **🛠 Comprehensive Remote Management:** Easily add, edit, delete, or clone remotes using an intuitive wizard.
* **🔐 OAuth & Interactive Setup:** Seamless browser-based authentication for popular services like OneDrive, Google Drive, and iCloud.
* **🔑 Encrypted Configuration Support:** Securely stores your passwords using your system's native keyring (Keyring / Credential Store).
* **📁 Mount Cloud Storage:** Mount your cloud accounts as local drives (with support for mount, mount2, and NFS).
* **🔄 Sync & Copy:** Perform one-way synchronization and file copying between remotes or local folders.
* **↔️ Bidirectional Sync (Bisync):** Keep two locations (e.g., your local folder and the cloud) perfectly in sync in both directions.
* **🚚 Move Operations:** Transfer files from one location to another without leaving copies behind.

# Feedback and Contribution

The main reason I'm sharing this project is to get **feedback** from you all.

* What difficulties did you face while testing the app?
* What do you think could be better?
* What ""must-have"" features do you think are missing?

I'm aiming for this to be a tool that can solve the cloud storage problem, especially for people new to Linux. All your feedback and contributions are incredibly valuable for making the project better.
